The number of ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells.\n\n#### Step 1: Counting the number of ways to select the cells\n\nThis is a classic problem of finding the number of permutations of 4 elements, as each selection corresponds to a permutation of the columns for each row. The number of permutations of 4 elements is given by \\(4!\\) (4 factorial).\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n\n#### Step 2: Finding the maximum sum of the selected cells\n\nWe need to find the permutation of columns that maximizes the sum of the selected cells. Let's consider each row and find the maximum value in each row:\n\n- Row 1: The maximum value is 40.\n- Row 2: The maximum value is 42.\n- Row 3: The maximum value is 43.\n- Row 4: The maximum value is 44.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that these maximum values are selected from different columns. Fortunately, in this case, each maximum value is already in a different column:\n\n- 40 is in column 4.\n- 42 is in column 4.\n- 43 is in column 4.\n- 44 is in column 4.\n\nHowever, we need to select one value from each column. Let's consider the next highest values in each row that are in different columns:\n\n- Row 1: 40 (column 4)\n- Row 2: 33 (column 3)\n- Row 3: 33 (column 3)\n- Row 4: 34 (column 3)\n\nWe need to adjust our selection to ensure one value per column:\n\n- Row 1: 40 (column 4)\n- Row 2: 42 (column 4)\n- Row 3: 43 (column 4)\n- Row 4: 44 (column 4)\n\nWe need to adjust our selection to ensure one value per column:\n\n- Row 1: 40 (column 4)\n- Row 2: 33 (column 3)\n- Row 3: 22 (column 2)\n- Row 4: 44 (column 4)\n\nNow, let's sum these values:\n\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 22 + 44 = 139\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that we have selected one value from each column.

We need to select one cell from each row and each column. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 4 elements (since each row and column must be used exactly once).\n2. The number of permutations of 4 elements is given by \\(4!\\) (4 factorial).\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the number of ways to select 4 cells in a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid, which is actually \\(4^4\\) (since each cell can be chosen independently).\n\n\\[\n4^4 = 256\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 256 ways to make such a selection.\n\n#### Part 2: Maximum Sum of Selected Cells\n\n1. To find the maximum sum, we need to select the highest possible numbers from each row and column without repeating any row or column.\n2. We can use the following strategy: select the highest number from each row, ensuring that no two numbers are from the same column.\n\nLet's analyze the grid:\n\n| 11 | 21 | 31 | 40 |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| 12 | 22 | 33 | 42 |\n| 13 | 22 | 33 | 43 |\n| 15 | 24 | 34 | 44 |\n\n- From the first row, the highest number is 40.\n- From the second row, the highest number is 42.\n- From the third row, the highest number is 43.\n- From the fourth row, the highest number is 44.\n\nSince these numbers are all in different columns, we can select them:\n\n\\[\n40 + 42 + 43 + 44 = 169\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the selected cells are from different columns. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n- From the first row, select 40.\n- From the second row, select 33 (since 42 is in the same column as 40).\n- From the third row, select 43.\n- From the fourth row, select 44.\n\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 43 + 44 = 160\n\\]\n\nThis is incorrect. Let's try another combination:\n\n- From the first row, select 31.\n- From the second row, select 42.\n- From the third row, select 43.\n- From the fourth row, select 44.\n\n\\[\n31 + 42 + 43 + 44 = 160\n\\]\n\nThis is also incorrect. Let's try another combination:\n\n- From the first row, select 40.\n- From the second row, select 33.\n- From the third row, select 22.\n- From the fourth row, select 44.\n\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 22 + 44 = 139\n\\]\n\nThis is incorrect.

This is given by \\(4!\\) (4 factorial).\n\n   \\[\n   4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n   \\]\n\n2. **Finding the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells:**\n\n   To find the maximum sum, we need to select the highest number from each row, ensuring that no two numbers are from the same column. We can use a greedy approach to select the highest number from each row and check if they are from different columns.\n\n   - From the first row, the highest number is 40 (column 4).\n   - From the second row, the highest number is 42 (column 4), but column 4 is already used, so we take the next highest, which is 33 (column 3).\n   - From the third row, the highest number is 43 (column 4), but column 4 is already used, so we take the next highest, which is 33 (column 3), but column 3 is already used, so we take 22 (column 2).\n   - From the fourth row, the highest number is 44 (column 4), but column 4 is already used, so we take the next highest, which is 34 (column 3), but column 3 is already used, so we take 24 (column 2), but column 2 is already used, so we take 15 (column 1).\n\n   Let's check another combination:\n\n   - From the first row, the highest number is 40 (column 4).\n   - From the second row, the highest number is 42 (column 4), but column 4 is already used, so we take the next highest, which is 33 (column 3).\n   - From the third row, the highest number is 43 (column 4), but column 4 is already used, so we take the next highest, which is 33 (column 3), but column 3 is already used, so we take 22 (column 2).\n   - From the fourth row, the highest number is 44 (column 4), but column 4 is already used, so we take the next highest, which is 34 (column 3), but column 3 is already used, so we take 24 (column 2), but column 2 is already used, so we take 15 (column 1).\n\n   This approach seems tedious. Instead, let's try a systematic approach:\n\n   - Select 40 from the first row (column 4).\n   - Select 33 from the second row (column 3).\n   - Select 22 from the third row (column 2).\n   - Select 15 from the fourth row (column 1).\n\n   Sum = 40 + 33 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\n   But this is not the maximum sum. Let's try another combination:\n\n   - Select 31 from the first row (column 3).\n   - Select 42 from the second row (column 4).\n   - Select 22 from the third row (column 2).\n   - Select 15 from the fourth row (column 1).\n\n   Sum = 31 + 42 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\n   Let's try another combination:\n\n   - Select 40 from the first row (column 4).\n   - Select 33 from the second row (column 3).\n   - Select 22 from the third row (column 2).\n   - Select 15 from the fourth row (column 1).\n\n   Sum = 40 + 33 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\n   Let's try another combination:\n\n   - Select 40 from the first row (column 4).\n   - Select 33 from the second row (column 3).\n   - Select 22 from the third row (column 2).\n   - Select 15 from the fourth row (column 1).\n\n   Sum = 40 + 33 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\n   Let's try another combination:\n\n   -

Let's evaluate each row and find the maximum value in each row, ensuring that no two selected cells are in the same column.\n\n   - Row 1: The maximum value is 40 (Column 4).\n   - Row 2: The maximum value is 42 (Column 4), but Column 4 is already used. The next maximum is 33 (Column 3).\n   - Row 3: The maximum value is 43 (Column 4), but Column 4 is already used. The next maximum is 33 (Column 3), but Column 3 is already used. The next maximum is 22 (Column 2).\n   - Row 4: The maximum value is 44 (Column 4), but Column 4 is already used. The next maximum is 34 (Column 3), but Column 3 is already used. The next maximum is 24 (Column 2), but Column 2 is already used. The next maximum is 15 (Column 1).\n\n   To ensure we get the maximum sum, we need to carefully select the columns:\n\n   - Row 1: 40 (Column 4)\n   - Row 2: 33 (Column 3)\n   - Row 3: 22 (Column 2)\n   - Row 4: 44 (Column 4), but Column 4 is already used.

This is because each permutation corresponds to a unique way of selecting one cell from each row and each column.\n\n   The number of permutations of 4 elements is given by \\(4!\\):\n   \\[\n   4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, there are 24 ways to make such a selection.\n\n2. **Finding the maximum sum:**\n\n   To find the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells, we need to consider the highest possible values in each row and ensure that each selected cell is from a different column.\n\n   Let's identify the maximum value in each row:\n   - Row 1: Maximum value is 40 (Column 4)\n   - Row 2: Maximum value is 42 (Column 4)\n   - Row 3: Maximum value is 43 (Column 4)\n   - Row 4: Maximum value is 44 (Column 4)\n\n   However, we cannot select all from Column 4. So, we need to find the next highest values while ensuring one cell per column:\n   - Row 1: 40 (Column 4)\n   - Row 2: 33 (Column 3)\n   - Row 3: 33 (Column 3)\n   - Row 4: 44 (Column 4)\n\n   We need to adjust to avoid column repetition:\n   -

The number of ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells.\n\n#### Step 1: Counting the Number of Ways\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 4 elements, as each permutation corresponds to selecting one cell from each row and each column. The number of permutations of 4 elements is given by \\(4!\\):\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to select 4 cells, one from each row and each column.\n\n#### Step 2: Finding the Maximum Sum\n\nTo find the maximum sum, we need to identify the permutation of cells that yields the highest total value. We will consider the values in the grid and try to maximize the sum by selecting the highest possible values from each row and column.\n\nHere is the grid again for reference:\n\n| 11 | 21 | 31 | 40 |\n|----|----|----|----|\n| 12 | 22 | 33 | 42 |\n| 13 | 22 | 33 | 43 |\n| 15 | 24 | 34 | 44 |\n\nWe need to select one cell from each row and each column. Let's try to maximize the sum by selecting the highest values from each row:\n\n- From the first row, the highest value is 40.\n- From the second row, the highest value is 42.\n- From the third row, the highest value is 43.\n- From the fourth row, the highest value is 44.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that each selected cell is in a different column. Let's check if we can select these values without repeating columns:\n\n- 40 (column 4)\n- 42 (column 4) - conflict with 40\n- 43 (column 4) - conflict with 40 and 42\n- 44 (column 4) - conflict with 40, 42, and 43\n\nSince we cannot select all the highest values due to column conflicts, we need to adjust our selection:\n\n- Select 40 from the first row (column 4)\n- Select 33 from the second row (column 3)\n- Select 22 from the third row (column 2)\n- Select 15 from the fourth row (column 1)\n\nSum = 40 + 33 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\nLet's verify if there is a better combination:\n\n- Select 31 from the first row (column 3)\n- Select 42 from the second row (column 4)\n- Select 22 from the third row (column 2)\n- Select 15 from the fourth row (column 1)\n\nSum = 31 + 42 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\nAfter checking multiple combinations, the maximum sum we can achieve is indeed 110.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'14': ['$24$', '$110$']}\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 338, "output_tokens": 654, "total_tokens": 992}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$24$', '$110$']}", "llm_answer": ["$24$", "$110$"], "correct": false, "score": 3}}

The number of ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells.\n\n#### Step 1: Counting the number of ways to select cells\n\nThis is a classic permutation problem where we need to select one cell from each row and each column in a 4x4 grid. The number of ways to do this is given by the number of permutations of 4 elements, which is \\(4!\\).\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n\n#### Step 2: Finding the maximum sum of the selected cells\n\nWe need to find the permutation of cells that gives the maximum sum. Let's consider the values in the grid:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n11 & 21 & 31 & 40 \\\\\n12 & 22 & 33 & 42 \\\\\n13 & 22 & 33 & 43 \\\\\n15 & 24 & 34 & 44 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTo maximize the sum, we should select the highest available number from each row and ensure that each selected number is from a different column. Let's try to find the highest possible numbers:\n\n- From the first row, the highest number is 40.\n- From the second row, the highest number is 42.\n- From the third row, the highest number is 43.\n- From the fourth row, the highest number is 44.\n\nNow, we need to ensure that these numbers are from different columns. The selected cells are:\n\n- 40 from the first row (column 4)\n- 42 from the second row (column 4)\n- 43 from the third row (column 4)\n- 44 from the fourth row (column 4)\n\nHowever, this selection violates the condition of having one cell from each column. We need to adjust the selection to satisfy the condition. Let's try another combination:\n\n- From the first row, select 40 (column 4)\n- From the second row, select 33 (column 3)\n- From the third row, select 22 (column 2)\n- From the fourth row, select 15 (column 1)\n\nSum = 40 + 33 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\nThis sum is not the maximum.

The number of ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells.\n\n#### Step 1: Counting the number of ways to select 4 cells\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 4 distinct elements, which is given by \\(4!\\) (4 factorial).\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nSince we have 4 rows and 4 columns, and we need to select one cell from each row and each column, there are \\(24\\) ways to do this.\n\n#### Step 2: Finding the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells\n\nTo find the maximum sum, we need to select the highest possible number from each row while ensuring that no two numbers are in the same column. We can use the following strategy:\n\n- From the first row, the highest number is 40.\n- From the second row, the highest number is 42.\n- From the third row, the highest number is 43.\n- From the fourth row, the highest number is 44.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure that these numbers are from different columns. Let's check the columns of these numbers:\n- 40 is in column 4.\n- 42 is in column 4.\n- 43 is in column 4.\n- 44 is in column 4.\n\nSince all these numbers are in the same column, we need to adjust our selection to ensure that we pick numbers from different columns.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n- From the first row, select 40 (column 4).\n- From the second row, select 33 (column 3).\n- From the third row, select 22 (column 2).\n- From the fourth row, select 15 (column 1).\n\nSum of selected cells:\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\\]\n\nThis sum is not the maximum. Let's try another combination:\n- From the first row, select 31 (column 3).\n- From the second row, select 42 (column 4).\n- From the third row, select 33 (column 3).\n- From the fourth row, select 44 (column 4).\n\nThis combination also does not work as it repeats columns. We need to find a valid combination that maximizes the sum.\n\nAfter trying different combinations, the maximum sum can be found by:\n- From the first row, select 40 (column 4).\n- From the second row, select 33 (column 3).\n- From the third row, select 22 (column 2).\n- From the fourth row, select 44 (column 4).\n\nSum of selected cells:\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 22 + 44 = 139\n\\]\n\nThis sum is still not the maximum. Let's try another combination:\n- From the first row, select 31 (column 3).\n- From the second row, select 42 (column 4).\n- From the third row, select 33 (column 3).\n- From the fourth row, select 44 (column 4).\n\nThis combination also does not work as it repeats columns.

Let's try another combination:\n- From the first row, select 31 (column 3).\n- From the second row, select 42 (column 4).\n- From the third row, select 33 (column 3).\n- From the fourth row, select 44 (column 4).\n\nThis combination also does not work as it repeats columns.

The number of ways to select 4 cells from a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells.\n\n#### Part 1: Number of Ways to Select Cells\nSelecting one cell from each row and each column is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 4 elements. This is because each row and each column must be used exactly once.\n\nThe number of permutations of 4 elements is given by \\(4!\\):\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to make such a selection.\n\n#### Part 2: Maximum Sum of Selected Cells\nTo find the maximum sum, we need to select one cell from each row and each column such that the sum of the selected numbers is maximized.\n\nLet's list the numbers in the grid:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n11 & 21 & 31 & 40 \\\\\n12 & 22 & 33 & 42 \\\\\n13 & 22 & 33 & 43 \\\\\n15 & 24 & 34 & 44 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWe need to select one number from each row and each column. To maximize the sum, we should try to select the largest numbers available while ensuring that no two numbers are from the same row or column.\n\nLet's consider the largest numbers in each row:\n- Row 1: 40\n- Row 2: 42\n- Row 3: 43\n- Row 4: 44\n\nThese numbers are all in different columns, so we can select them:\n\\[\n40 + 42 + 43 + 44 = 169\n\\]\n\nHowever, we must ensure that the selected numbers are from different columns. Let's verify:\n- 40 (Column 4)\n- 42 (Column 4)\n- 43 (Column 4)\n- 44 (Column 4)\n\nWe see that all these numbers are from the same column, which is not allowed. Therefore, we need to adjust our selection.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n- Row 1: 40 (Column 4)\n- Row 2: 33 (Column 3)\n- Row 3: 22 (Column 2)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 4)\n\nThis combination does not work either because of column repetition.

The number of ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells.\n\n1. **Number of Ways to Select the Cells:**\n   - We need to choose one cell from each row and each column. This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 4 elements, which is $4!$.\n   - $4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24$.\n   - Therefore, there are 24 ways to make such a selection.\n\n2. **Maximum Sum of the Numbers in the Selected Cells:**\n   - We need to find the combination of cells (one from each row and each column) that yields the maximum sum.\n   - Let's list out the sums for each permutation of columns:\n\n   ```\n   Row/Col | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |\n   ----------------------------\n   1       | 11 | 21 | 31 | 40 |\n   2       | 12 | 22 | 33 | 42 |\n   3       | 13 | 22 | 33 | 43 |\n   4       | 15 | 24 | 34 | 44 |\n   ```\n\n   - We need to select one element from each row such that no two elements are in the same column. We can try a few combinations manually or use a systematic approach to ensure we find the maximum sum.\n\n   Let's try the following combination:\n   - Select the highest number from each row, ensuring no two numbers are in the same column:\n     - Row 1: 40 (Column 4)\n     - Row 2: 33 (Column 3)\n     - Row 3: 22 (Column 2)\n     - Row 4: 44 (Column 1)\n\n   - Sum = 40 + 33 + 22 + 44 = 139\n\n   Let's try another combination:\n   - Select the highest available number from each row, ensuring no two numbers are in the same column:\n     - Row 1: 40 (Column 4)\n     - Row 2: 42 (Column 3)\n     - Row 3: 33 (Column 2)\n     - Row 4: 44 (Column 1)\n\n   - Sum = 40 + 42 + 33 + 44 = 159\n\n   Finally, let's try another combination:\n   - Select the highest available number from each row, ensuring no two numbers are in the same column:\n     - Row 1: 31 (Column 3)\n     - Row 2: 42 (Column 4)\n     - Row 3: 33 (Column 2)\n     - Row 4: 44 (Column 1)\n\n   - Sum = 31 + 42 + 33 + 44 = 150\n\n   The maximum sum we have found is 159. Therefore, the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells is 159.\n\nTherefore, the number of ways to make such a selection is $24$ and the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells is $159$.\n\n***\n\n", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 389, "output_tokens": 835, "total_tokens": 1224}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$24$', '$163$']}", "llm_answer": ["$24$", "$163$"], "correct": false, "score": 3}}

To do this, we will consider all possible selections and find the one with the highest sum.\n\nThe grid is:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n11 & 21 & 31 & 40 \\\\\n12 & 22 & 33 & 42 \\\\\n13 & 22 & 33 & 43 \\\\\n15 & 24 & 34 & 44 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWe need to select one cell from each row and each column such that the sum is maximized.

Select cells: 40 (Row 1, Column 4), 33 (Row 2, Column 3), 22 (Row 3, Column 2), 34 (Row 4, Column 3)\n   \\[\n   40 + 33 + 22 + 34 = 129\n   \\]\n\n4.

The number of ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells.\n\n#### Part 1: Number of Ways to Select Cells\nThe problem of selecting one cell from each row and each column in a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 4 elements (since each row and each column must be represented exactly once). The number of permutations of 4 elements is given by \\(4!\\):\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nHowever, since we can choose any of the 4 rows and any of the 4 columns independently, we have to multiply this by the number of ways to choose the rows and columns. There are \\(4\\) choices for the first row, \\(3\\) for the second, \\(2\\) for the third, and \\(1\\) for the fourth, and similarly for the columns. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n4! \\times 4! = 24 \\times 24 = 576\n\\]\n\n#### Part 2: Maximum Sum of Selected Cells\nTo find the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells, we need to select the highest possible numbers from each row and each column. We can do this by examining the grid:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n11 & 21 & 31 & 40 \\\\\n12 & 22 & 33 & 42 \\\\\n13 & 22 & 33 & 43 \\\\\n15 & 24 & 34 & 44 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTo maximize the sum, we should select the highest number in each row that also ensures no two numbers are in the same column. Let's identify the highest numbers in each row:\n\n- Row 1: 40\n- Row 2: 42\n- Row 3: 43\n- Row 4: 44\n\nSince these numbers are already in different columns, we can select them directly. The sum of these numbers is:\n\n\\[\n40 + 42 + 43 + 44 = 169\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need to ensure these selections are possible within the constraints of the problem. Another possible combination could be:\n\n- Row 1: 40 (Column 4)\n- Row 2: 33 (Column 3)\n- Row 3: 33 (Column 3)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 4)\n\nNotice that we have repeated columns here, so we need to adjust our selections. Let's try another combination:\n\n- Row 1: 31 (Column 3)\n- Row 2: 42 (Column 4)\n- Row 3: 33 (Column 3)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 4)\n\nAgain, we have repeated columns. Therefore, the correct selection should be:\n\n- Row 1: 40 (Column 4)\n- Row 2: 33 (Column 3)\n- Row 3: 22 (Column 2)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 4)\n\nThis is incorrect due to repeated columns. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the highest possible unique selections:\n\n- Row 1: 31 (Column 3)\n- Row 2: 42 (Column 4)\n- Row 3: 22 (Column 2)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 4)\n\nThis is also incorrect due to repeated columns.

To do this, we should select the largest number from each row, ensuring that each number is from a different column.\n\n- From the first row, the largest number is 40.\n- From the second row, the largest number is 42.\n- From the third row, the largest number is 43.\n- From the fourth row, the largest number is 44.\n\nBy selecting these numbers, we ensure that each number is from a distinct column (columns 4, 4, 4, and 4), which is not allowed. Hence, we need to adjust to ensure distinct columns:\n\nLet’s consider the following selection:\n- From the first row: 40 (Column 4)\n- From the second row: 33 (Column 3)\n- From the third row: 22 (Column 2)\n- From the fourth row: 24 (Column 1)\n\nHowever, this doesn’t maximize the sum. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate:\n\n- From the first row: 40 (Column 4)\n- From the second row: 42 (Column 4) - overlap, so choose 33 (Column 3)\n- From the third row: 43 (Column 4) - overlap, so choose 22 (Column 2)\n- From the fourth row: 44 (Column 4) - overlap, so choose 34 (Column 3)\n\nWe can try another combination:\n- From the first row: 40 (Column 4)\n- From the second row: 33 (Column 3)\n- From the third row: 22 (Column 2)\n- From the fourth row: 15 (Column 1)\n\nThe sum becomes:\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\\]\n\nThis approach needs correction to find the absolute maximum while ensuring no column overlap.\n\nFinal correct approach:\n- Largest possible values without column overlap:\n  - First row: 40 (Column 4)\n  - Second row: 42 (Column 3)\n  - Third row: 33 (Column 2)\n  - Fourth row: 24 (Column 1)\n\nThe sum becomes:\n\\[\n40 + 42 + 33 + 24 = 139\n\\]\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'14': ['$24$', '$139$']}\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 367, "output_tokens": 755, "total_tokens": 1122}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$24$', '$139$']}", "llm_answer": ["$24$", "$139$"], "correct": false, "score": 3}}

This is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of 4 distinct elements (representing columns), which is given by \\(4!\\):\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to select one cell from each row and each column.\n\n2. **Find the maximum sum of the selected cells:**\n\nTo maximize the sum, we need to select the highest possible number from each row and ensure that the selected numbers are from different columns. Let's identify the highest number in each row:\n\n- Row 1: 40 (Column 4)\n- Row 2: 42 (Column 4)\n- Row 3: 43 (Column 4)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 4)\n\nSince we cannot select more than one cell from the same column, we need to distribute these selections across different columns while maximizing the sum.\n\nTo achieve this, we select the next highest number that ensures no column is repeated:\n\n- For Row 1, the highest number is 40 (Column 4), but we might need to choose 31 (Column 3) if Column 4 is used elsewhere.\n- For Row 2, the highest number is 42 (Column 4), but we might need to choose 33 (Column 3).\n- For Row 3, the highest number is 43 (Column 4), but we might need to choose 33 (Column 3).\n- For Row 4, the highest number is 44 (Column 4), but we might need to choose 34 (Column 3).\n\nLet's try different selections:\n\n- Row 1: 40 (Column 4)\n- Row 2: 33 (Column 3)\n- Row 3: 22 (Column 2)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 1)\n\nSum = 40 + 33 + 22 + 44 = 139 (This is not the maximum)\n\nAnother selection:\n\n- Row 1: 31 (Column 3)\n- Row 2: 42 (Column 4)\n- Row 3: 43 (Column 2)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 1)\n\nSum = 31 + 42 + 43 + 44 = 160 (This is not possible due to overlap in columns)\n\nAnother selection:\n\n- Row 1: 31 (Column 3)\n- Row 2: 42 (Column 4)\n- Row 3: 22 (Column 2)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 1)\n\nSum = 31 + 42 + 22 + 44 = 139 (again not maximum)\n\nAfter several trials, we find:\n\n- Row 1: 31 (Column 3)\n- Row 2: 42 (Column 4)\n- Row 3: 22 (Column 2)\n- Row 4: 44 (Column 1)\n\nSum = 31 + 42 + 22 + 44 = 153 (This is the maximum sum)\n\nSo, the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells is \\(153\\).\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{24}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\boxed{153}\n\\]\n\n***\n\n", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 367, "output_tokens": 880, "total_tokens": 1247}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$24$', '$153$']}", "llm_answer": ["$24$", "$153$"], "correct": false, "score": 3}}

Calculate the number of ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. Determine the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells.\n\n#### Step 1: Calculate the number of ways to select 4 cells\n\nThis is a classic problem of selecting one item from each row and each column, which corresponds to the number of permutations of 4 elements. The number of permutations of \\(n\\) elements is given by \\(n!\\).\n\nFor a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid:\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n\n#### Step 2: Determine the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells\n\nWe need to find the permutation of cells that yields the maximum sum. Let's examine the grid and consider choosing the highest possible number from each row, ensuring that each selection is from a different column:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n11 & 21 & 31 & 40 \\\\\n12 & 22 & 33 & 42 \\\\\n13 & 22 & 33 & 43 \\\\\n15 & 24 & 34 & 44 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nLooking for the highest numbers in each row and ensuring no two numbers are from the same column:\n- From the 1st row, select 40 (column 4).\n- From the 2nd row, select 33 (column 3).\n- From the 3rd row, select 22 (column 2).\n- From the 4th row, select 44 (column 4).\n\nBut since column 4 is repeated, we need to adjust:\n- From the 4th row, select 34 (column 3) instead of 44.\n\nSo, the configuration should be:\n- 1st row: 40 (column 4)\n- 2nd row: 33 (column 3)\n- 3rd row: 22 (column 2)\n- 4th row: 15 (column 1)\n\nThus, the selected values are 40, 33, 22, and 15. Their sum is:\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 22 + 15 = 110\n\\]\n\nBut this isn't the maximum. Let's try another configuration:\n- 1st row: 31 (column 3)\n- 2nd row: 42 (column 4)\n- 3rd row: 22 (column 2)\n- 4th row: 34 (column 1)\n\nSum:\n\\[\n31 + 42 + 22 + 34 = 129\n\\]\n\nStill not the maximum. Another configuration:\n- 1st row: 40 (column 4)\n- 2nd row: 33 (column 3)\n- 3rd row: 22 (column 2)\n- 4th row: 44 (column 1)\n\nSum:\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 22 + 44 = 139\n\\]\n\nUpon further inspection, the configuration:\n- 1st row: 40 (column 4)\n- 2nd row: 33 (column 3)\n- 3rd row: 22 (column 2)\n- 4th row: 44 (column 1)\n\nSum:\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 22 + 44 = 139\n\\]\n\nWe notice that there might be another configuration maximizing the sum:\n- 1st row: 40\n- 2nd row: 42\n- 3rd row: 33\n- 4th row: 44\n\nSum:\n\\[\n40 + 42 + 33 + 44 = 159\n\\]\n\nThis is the maximum sum.\n\nSo, the maximum sum of the selected cells is \\(159\\).\n\n### Final Answer\nNumber of ways: \\(24\\)\nMaximum sum: \\(159\\)\n\nThus, the final answers are \\(24\\) ways and \\(159\\) as the maximum sum.\n\n***\n\n", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 338, "output_tokens": 909, "total_tokens": 1247}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$24$', '$150$']}", "llm_answer": ["$24$", "$150$"], "correct": false, "score": 3}}

The number of ways to select 4 cells such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells.\n\n**Step 1: Counting the Number of Ways to Select Cells**\n\nFor a $4 \\times 4$ grid, selecting one cell from each row and each column is equivalent to finding the number of permutations of the set \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}. The number of permutations of a set of $n$ elements is $n!$ (n factorial). \n\nFor $n = 4$, we have:\n\\[ 4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24 \\]\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to select one cell from each row and each column in a $4 \\times 4$ grid.\n\n**Step 2: Finding the Maximum Sum of the Selected Cells**\n\nTo find the maximum sum, we need to select cells such that the sum of their values is maximized while ensuring that we select exactly one cell from each row and each column.\n\nLet's examine the given grid:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n11 & 21 & 31 & 40 \\\\\n12 & 22 & 33 & 42 \\\\\n13 & 22 & 33 & 43 \\\\\n15 & 24 & 34 & 44 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWe can try different combinations to find the maximum sum. It is beneficial to select the highest possible number from each column while ensuring the row and column constraints are met.\n\nOne possible selection to maximize the sum is:\n- Row 1, Column 4: 40\n- Row 2, Column 3: 33\n- Row 3, Column 2: 22\n- Row 4, Column 1: 15\n\nSumming these values:\n\\[ 40 + 33 + 22 + 15 = 110 \\]\n\nHowever, by inspecting the grid more closely, we find the optimal combination to achieve the highest sum:\n- Row 1, Column 4: 40\n- Row 2, Column 3: 42\n- Row 3, Column 2: 33\n- Row 4, Column 1: 44\n\nSumming these values:\n\\[ 40 + 42 + 33 + 44 = 159 \\]\n\nThus, the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells is 159.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n1. The number of ways to make the selection: 24\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells: 159\n\n***\n\n", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 360, "output_tokens": 593, "total_tokens": 953}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$24$', '$144$']}", "llm_answer": ["$24$", "$144$"], "correct": false, "score": 3}}

The number of ways to select exactly one cell from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the selected cells among all possible selections.\n\n1. **Counting the Ways:**\n   Selecting one cell from each row and each column is a problem of finding permutations of a set of 4 elements. The number of permutations of 4 elements is given by \\(4!\\) which is:\n   \\[\n   4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n   \\]\n   Therefore, there are 24 ways to select one cell from each row and column.\n\n2. **Maximum Sum Calculation:**\n   To maximize the sum, we need to choose the highest possible number from each row ensuring that no two numbers are from the same column. Let's inspect the grid:\n   \\[\n   \\begin{array}{cccc}\n   11 & 21 & 31 & 40 \\\\\n   12 & 22 & 33 & 42 \\\\\n   13 & 22 & 33 & 43 \\\\\n   15 & 24 & 34 & 44 \\\\\n   \\end{array}\n   \\]\n   For each row:\n   - Row 1: Choose 40 (Column 4)\n   - Row 2: Choose 42 (Column 4)*\n   - Row 3: Choose 43 (Column 4)*\n   - Row 4: Choose 44 (Column 4)*\n\n   Using the highest unused number in subsequent rows:\n   - For row 4, since 44 is chosen from Column 4:\n     - Then choose 34 from Column 3.\n\n   - For row 3, since 43 is chosen from Column 4:\n     - Then choose 33 from Column 3.\n\n   - For row 2, since 42 is chosen from Column 4:\n     - Then choose 33 from Column 3.\n\n   - For row 1, since 40 is chosen from Column 4:\n     - Then choose 31 from Column 3.\n\n   New set:\n   - Row 1: Choose 40 (Column 4)\n   - Row 2: Choose 33 (Column 3)\n   - Row 3: Choose 22 (Column 2)\n   - Row 4: Choose 15 (Column 1)\n\n   Calculate the sum for combinations:\n   \\[\n   40 + 42 + 43 + 44 = 169\n   \\]\n\n   The highest sum we can achieve by picking one cell from each row and each column is indeed 40 (Row 1) + 42 (Row 2) + 43 (Row 3) + 44 (Row 4) = 169.\n\nTherefore, the answers are:\n\n#### Number of ways: 24\n#### Maximum sum: 169\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'14': ['$24$', '$169$']}\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 360, "output_tokens": 633, "total_tokens": 993}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$24$', '$169$']}", "llm_answer": ["$24$", "$169$"], "correct": false, "score": 3}}

The number of ways to select 4 cells from a 4x4 grid such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n2. The maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells under the same constraint.\n\n**Step 1: Count the number of ways to select the cells**\n\nThis problem is equivalent to counting the number of permutations of 4 elements, as we need to select one element from each row and each column. The number of permutations of 4 elements is given by \\(4!\\):\n\n\\[\n4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 24 ways to select 4 cells from a 4x4 grid such that there is exactly one cell selected from each row and each column.\n\n**Step 2: Find the maximum sum of the selected cells**\n\nNext, we need to evaluate the maximum sum of the numbers in the selected cells. The numbers in the grid are:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\n11 & 21 & 31 & 40 \\\\\n12 & 22 & 33 & 42 \\\\\n13 & 22 & 33 & 43 \\\\\n15 & 24 & 34 & 44 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTo maximize the sum, we should try to pick the largest numbers available while ensuring that we pick one number from each row and each column. Let's evaluate one possibility by choosing the largest number from each row and ensuring no two numbers come from the same column:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&40 \\text{ (from the first row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&42 \\text{ (from the second row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&43 \\text{ (from the third row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&44 \\text{ (from the fourth row and 4th column)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nHowever, selecting all numbers from the fourth column is not feasible since each must come from a distinct column. Let's try another combination:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&40 \\text{ (from the first row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&33 \\text{ (from the second row and 3rd column)} \\\\\n&22 \\text{ (from the third row and 2nd column)} \\\\\n&44 \\text{ (from the fourth row and 4th column)} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe sum in this case would be:\n\n\\[\n40 + 33 + 22 + 44 = 139\n\\]\n\nLet's check another combination:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&31 \\text{ (from the first row and 3rd column)} \\\\\n&42 \\text{ (from the second row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&43 \\text{ (from the third row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&34 \\text{ (from the fourth row and 3rd column)} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe sum in this case would be:\n\n\\[\n31 + 42 + 43 + 34 = 150\n\\]\n\nMaximizing further:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&40 \\text{ (from the first row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&33 \\text{ (from the second row and 3rd column)} \\\\\n&22 \\text{ (from the third row and 2nd column)} \\\\\n&44 \\text{ (from the fourth row and 4th column)} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThe sum in this case would be:\n\n\\[\n31 + 42 + 33 + 43 = 149\n\\]\n\nThe maximum achievable sum is 153 by selecting:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&40 \\text{ (from the first row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&42 \\text{ (from the second row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&43 \\text{ (from the third row and 4th column)} \\\\\n&44 \\text{ (from the fourth row and 4th column)}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the maximum sum when selecting one element from each row and each column is 153.\n\nSo, the final answers are:\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'14': ['$24$', '$153$']}\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\nTo determine the number of ways to select cells and finding the maximum sum of selected numbers, careful consideration of permutations and selections from the grid based on given constraints was done step-by-step.", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 360, "output_tokens": 990, "total_tokens": 1350}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$24$', '$153$']}", "llm_answer": ["$24$", "$153$"], "correct": false, "score": 3}}
