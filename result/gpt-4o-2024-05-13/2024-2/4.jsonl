Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ values.\n   - Cumulative frequencies:\n     - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n     - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n   - The $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ values fall in the $[1050, 1100)$ range.\n   - Therefore, the median yield per acre is in the $[1050, 1100)$ range, which means it is greater than $1050$ kilograms.\n\n2. **Percentage of fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms**:\n   - Fields with yields in $[900, 950)$ and $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n   - Percentage: $\\frac{18}{100} \\times 100\\% = 18\\%$\n   - This is less than $80\\%$.\n\n3. **Range of yields**:\n   - Minimum yield: $900$ kilograms\n   - Maximum yield: $1200$ kilograms\n   - Range: $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms\n\n4. **Average yield**:\n   - To find the average, we need the midpoints of each interval and their frequencies:\n     - $[900, 950)$: midpoint $925$, frequency $6$\n     - $[950, 1000)$: midpoint $975$, frequency $12$\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: midpoint $1025$, frequency $18$\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: midpoint $1075$, frequency $24$\n     - $[1100, 1150)$: midpoint $1125$, frequency $18$\n     - $[1150, 1200)$: midpoint $1175$, frequency $10$\n   - Weighted average: \n     \\[\n     \\frac{(925 \\times 6) + (975 \\times 12) + (1025 \\times 18) + (1075 \\times 24) + (1125 \\times 18) + (1175 \\times 10)}{100}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750}{100}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{93500}{100} = 935 \\text{ kilograms}\n     \\]\n   - The average yield is $935$ kilograms, which is between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n- A.

Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ values. \n\n  The cumulative frequencies are:\n  - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n  - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n  - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n  - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n  - $[1100, 1150)$: $60 + 18 = 78$\n  - $[1150, 1200)$: $78 + 10 = 88$\n\n  The $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ values fall in the $[1050, 1100)$ range. Therefore, the median yield per acre is in this range, which means the median yield per acre is less than $1050$ kilograms. Hence, option A is correct.\n\n- **Option B: More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n  The cumulative frequency for yields less than $1000$ kilograms is $18$. This is $18\\%$ of the total $100$ fields, which is far less than $80\\%$. Hence, option B is incorrect.\n\n- **Option C: The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.**\n\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The minimum yield is in the $[900, 950)$ range, and the maximum yield is in the $[1150, 1200)$ range. The range is approximately $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This does not fit the given range of $200$ to $300$ kilograms. Hence, option C is incorrect.\n\n- **Option D: The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n  To find the average yield, we need to calculate the weighted average of the midpoints of each interval:\n  - Midpoint of $[900, 950)$: $925$\n  - Midpoint of $[950, 1000)$: $975$\n  - Midpoint of $[1000, 1050)$: $1025$\n  - Midpoint of $[1050, 1100)$: $1075$\n  - Midpoint of $[1100, 1150)$: $1125$\n  - Midpoint of $[1150, 1200)$: $1175$\n\n  Weighted average:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{6 \\times 925 + 12 \\times 975 + 18 \\times 1025 + 24 \\times 1075 + 18 \\times 1125 + 10 \\times 1175}{100} = \\frac{5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750}{100} = \\frac{93500}{100} = 935\n  \\]\n\n  The average yield is $935$ kilograms, which is between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms. Hence, option D is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 498, "output_tokens": 788, "total_tokens": 1286}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values.\n  - From the table, the cumulative frequencies are:\n    - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n    - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n    - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n    - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n  - The $50$th and $51$st values fall in the $[1050, 1100)$ range.\n  - Therefore, the median yield per acre is in the $[1050, 1100)$ range, which means it is less than $1100$ kilograms but more than $1050$ kilograms. Thus, option A is correct.\n\n- **Option B: More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms.**\n  - From the cumulative frequency, $18$ fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms.\n  - $18$ out of $100$ fields is $18\\%$, which is not more than $80\\%$. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n- **Option C: The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.**\n  - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n  - The minimum yield is in the $[900, 950)$ range, and the maximum yield is in the $[1150, 1200)$ range.\n  - The range is approximately $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. However, the exact range could be slightly less than $300$ kilograms but not as low as $200$ kilograms. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n- **Option D: The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.**\n  - To find the average, we need the sum of all yields divided by the number of fields.\n  - The midpoint of each yield range can be used to estimate the average:\n    - $[900, 950)$: midpoint = $925$, contribution = $6 \\times 925 = 5550$\n    - $[950, 1000)$: midpoint = $975$, contribution = $12 \\times 975 = 11700$\n    - $[1000, 1050)$: midpoint = $1025$, contribution = $18 \\times 1025 = 18450$\n    - $[1050, 1100)$: midpoint = $1075$, contribution = $24 \\times 1075 = 25800$\n    - $[1100, 1150)$: midpoint = $1125$, contribution = $18 \\times 1125 = 20250$\n    - $[1150, 1200)$: midpoint = $1175$, contribution = $10 \\times 1175 = 11750$\n  - Total yield = $5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750 = 93500$\n  - Average yield = $\\frac{93500}{100} = 935$ kilograms\n  - The average yield is between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms, but since option A is already correct and only one option can be correct, option D is not the best choice.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option A.\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 549, "output_tokens": 1115, "total_tokens": 1664}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values. We can determine the position of these values by looking at the cumulative frequencies:\n\n  - $[900, 950)$: $6$ fields\n  - $[950, 1000)$: $12$ fields (cumulative: $6 + 12 = 18$)\n  - $[1000, 1050)$: $18$ fields (cumulative: $18 + 18 = 36$)\n  - $[1050, 1100)$: $24$ fields (cumulative: $36 + 24 = 60$)\n\n  The $50$th and $51$st values fall within the $[1050, 1100)$ range. Therefore, the median yield per acre is in the $[1050, 1100)$ range, which means it is greater than $1050$ kilograms. Thus, **Option A is incorrect**.\n\n- **Option B: More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n  The cumulative frequency for yields less than $1000$ kilograms is $6 + 12 = 18$ fields. This is $18\\%$ of the total $100$ fields, which is far less than $80\\%$. Therefore, **Option B is incorrect**.\n\n- **Option C: The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.**\n\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The minimum yield is in the $[900, 950)$ range, and the maximum yield is in the $[1150, 1200)$ range. Therefore, the range is at least $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. So, **Option C is incorrect**.\n\n- **Option D: The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n  To find the average yield, we need to calculate the weighted mean of the midpoints of each interval:\n\n  - Midpoint of $[900, 950)$: $925$\n  - Midpoint of $[950, 1000)$: $975$\n  - Midpoint of $[1000, 1050)$: $1025$\n  - Midpoint of $[1050, 1100)$: $1075$\n  - Midpoint of $[1100, 1150)$: $1125$\n  - Midpoint of $[1150, 1200)$: $1175$\n\n  Using the frequencies, the weighted mean is:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{6 \\times 925 + 12 \\times 975 + 18 \\times 1025 + 24 \\times 1075 + 18 \\times 1125 + 10 \\times 1175}{100}\n  \\]\n\n  Calculating this:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750}{100} = \\frac{93500}{100} = 935\n  \\]\n\n  The average yield per acre is $935$ kilograms, which is indeed between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms. Therefore, **Option D is correct**.\n\nGiven that none of the options A, B, or C are correct, and option D is correct, the correct answer is **D**.\n\n***\n\n", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 498, "output_tokens": 829, "total_tokens": 1327}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values.\n   - Cumulative frequencies:\n     - $[900, 950)$: 6 fields\n     - $[950, 1000)$: 6 + 12 = 18 fields\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: 18 + 18 = 36 fields\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: 36 + 24 = 60 fields\n     - $[1100, 1150)$: 60 + 18 = 78 fields\n     - $[1150, 1200)$: 78 + 10 = 88 fields\n\n   - The 50th and 51st values fall in the $[1050, 1100)$ range. Therefore, the median yield is in this range, which is greater than $1050$ kilograms.\n\n2. **Percentage of Fields with Yields Less Than 1000 kg**:\n   - Fields with yields less than 1000 kg: 6 (from $[900, 950)$) + 12 (from $[950, 1000)$) = 18 fields.\n   - Percentage: $\\frac{18}{100} \\times 100\\% = 18\\%$.\n   - This is much less than 80%.\n\n3. **Range of Yields**:\n   - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n   - Minimum yield: 900 kg (from $[900, 950)$).\n   - Maximum yield: 1200 kg (from $[1150, 1200)$).\n   - Range: $1200 - 900 = 300$ kg.\n   - The range is exactly 300 kg, not between 200 kg and 300 kg.\n\n4. **Average Yield Calculation**:\n   - To estimate the average yield, we use the midpoint of each interval and multiply by the frequency:\n     - $[900, 950)$: midpoint = 925, contribution = $925 \\times 6 = 5550$\n     - $[950, 1000)$: midpoint = 975, contribution = $975 \\times 12 = 11700$\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: midpoint = 1025, contribution = $1025 \\times 18 = 18450$\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: midpoint = 1075, contribution = $1075 \\times 24 = 25800$\n     - $[1100, 1150)$: midpoint = 1125, contribution = $1125 \\times 18 = 20250$\n     - $[1150, 1200)$: midpoint = 1175, contribution = $1175 \\times 10 = 11750$\n\n   - Total yield = $5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750 = 93500$ kg.\n   - Average yield = $\\frac{93500}{100} = 935$ kg.\n   - The average yield is between 900 kg and 1000 kg.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n- A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms.\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 520, "output_tokens": 772, "total_tokens": 1292}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st yields.\n   - Cumulative frequencies:\n     - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n     - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n     - $[1100, 1150)$: $60 + 18 = 78$\n     - $[1150, 1200)$: $78 + 10 = 88$\n   - Since the cumulative frequency reaches 50 at the $[1050, 1100)$ interval, the median yield is within this range, which is $1050$ to $1100$ kilograms. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n\n2. **Percentage of Fields with Yield Less than $1000$ Kilograms:**\n   - Fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms:\n     - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n     - $[950, 1000)$: $12$\n     - Total: $6 + 12 = 18$\n   - Percentage: $\\frac{18}{100} \\times 100\\% = 18\\%$\n   - This is much less than $80\\%$. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n3. **Range of Yields:**\n   - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum yields.\n   - Minimum yield: $900$ kilograms (start of the first interval)\n   - Maximum yield: $1200$ kilograms (end of the last interval)\n   - Range: $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms\n   - Therefore, option C is correct.\n\n4. **Average Yield:**\n   - To estimate the average yield, we calculate the midpoint of each interval and multiply by the frequency, then sum these products and divide by the total number of fields.\n   - Midpoints:\n     - $[900, 950)$: $925$\n     - $[950, 1000)$: $975$\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: $1025$\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: $1075$\n     - $[1100, 1150)$: $1125$\n     - $[1150, 1200)$: $1175$\n   - Sum of products:\n     - $6 \\times 925 + 12 \\times 975 + 18 \\times 1025 + 24 \\times 1075 + 18 \\times 1125 + 10 \\times 1175$\n     - $= 5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750$\n     - $= 93450$\n   - Average yield: $\\frac{93450}{100} = 934.5$ kilograms\n   - Therefore, option D is incorrect.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['C']}\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 527, "output_tokens": 976, "total_tokens": 1503}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

An agricultural research department planted new rice varieties in $100$ equal-sized fields and recorded the per acre yield (in kilograms) for each field. The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n   | Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n   | Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\n   Based on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct?

The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms\n   - D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\n1. **Calculate the median yield:**\n   The median is the middle value of the ordered data set. Since there are 100 fields, the median yield will be the average of the 50th and 51st values. We need to find the intervals containing these values.\n\n   Cumulative frequencies:\n   - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n   - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n   - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n   - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n\n   The 50th and 51st values fall in the interval $[1050, 1100)$, which means the median yield is in this range. Therefore, the median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $1050$ and $1100$ kilograms, so option A is incorrect.\n\n2. **Percentage of fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms:**\n   Total fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms:\n   - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n   - $[950, 1000)$: $12$\n   - Total: $6 + 12 = 18$\n\n   Percentage: $\\frac{18}{100} \\times 100\\% = 18\\%$. This is much less than $80\\%$, so option B is incorrect.\n\n3. **Range of yields per acre:**\n   The lowest interval is $[900, 950)$ and the highest interval is $[1150, 1200)$. The approximate range is $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This fits within the range of $200$ to $300$ kilograms, so option C is correct.\n\n4. **Average yield per acre:**\n   To find the average, we need to calculate the midpoint of each interval and multiply by the frequency, then sum these products and divide by the total number of fields.\n\n   Midpoints:\n   - $[900, 950)$: $925$\n   - $[950, 1000)$: $975$\n   - $[1000, 1050)$: $1025$\n   - $[1050, 1100)$: $1075$\n   - $[1100, 1150)$: $1125$\n   - $[1150, 1200)$: $1175$\n\n   Weighted sum:\n   \\[\n   (6 \\times 925) + (12 \\times 975) + (18 \\times 1025) + (24 \\times 1075) + (18 \\times 1125) + (10 \\times 1175)\n   \\]\n\n   \\[\n   = 5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750 = 93500\n   \\]\n\n   Average yield:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{93500}{100} = 935 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n\n   The average yield per acre is $935$ kilograms, which is between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms, so option D is incorrect.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['C']}\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 549, "output_tokens": 982, "total_tokens": 1531}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ values when the data is arranged in ascending order.\n   - The cumulative frequencies are:\n     - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n     - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n     - $[1100, 1150)$: $60 + 18 = 78$\n     - $[1150, 1200)$: $78 + 10 = 88$\n\n   - Since the $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ values fall in the $[1050, 1100)$ range, the median yield per acre is in this range, which means it is greater than or equal to $1050$ kilograms.\n\n2. **Percentage of Fields with Yield Less than $1000$**:\n   - The number of fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms is $6 + 12 = 18$.\n   - The percentage is $\\frac{18}{100} \\times 100\\% = 18\\%$, which is much less than $80\\%$.\n\n3. **Range of Yields**:\n   - The minimum yield is in the $[900, 950)$ range, and the maximum yield is in the $[1150, 1200)$ range.\n   - The range is $1150 - 900 = 250$ kilograms, which is indeed between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.\n\n4. **Average Yield Calculation**:\n   - To calculate the average yield, we need to find the midpoint of each range and multiply by the frequency, then divide by the total number of fields.\n   - Midpoints: $925, 975, 1025, 1075, 1125, 1175$\n   - Weighted sum: $925 \\times 6 + 975 \\times 12 + 1025 \\times 18 + 1075 \\times 24 + 1125 \\times 18 + 1175 \\times 10 = 5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750 = 93500$\n   - Average yield: $\\frac{93500}{100} = 935$ kilograms, which is indeed between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms.\n\nFrom this analysis, the correct answer is:\n- A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n{'4': ['A']}\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 549, "output_tokens": 928, "total_tokens": 1477}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values. From the frequency distribution:\n  - The first 6 fields have yields in the range $[900, 950)$.\n  - The next 12 fields have yields in the range $[950, 1000)$.\n  - The next 18 fields have yields in the range $[1000, 1050)$.\n\n  So, the 50th and 51st fields fall in the range $[1000, 1050)$. Therefore, the median yield is in the range $[1000, 1050)$, which is less than $1050$ kilograms.\n\n- **Option B: More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n  The number of fields with yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms is $6 + 12 = 18$. This is $18\\%$ of the total fields, which is much less than $80\\%$.\n\n- **Option C: The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.**\n\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The minimum value is $900$ kilograms, and the maximum value is $1200$ kilograms. So, the range is $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms, which is exactly $300$ kilograms.\n\n- **Option D: The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n  To find the average (mean) yield, we need to calculate the total yield and divide it by the number of fields.

Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values.\n  - From the frequency table, we can see:\n    - $6$ fields have yields in the range $[900, 950)$.\n    - $12$ fields have yields in the range $[950, 1000)$.\n    - $18$ fields have yields in the range $[1000, 1050)$.\n    - $24$ fields have yields in the range $[1050, 1100)$.\n    - $18$ fields have yields in the range $[1100, 1150)$.\n    - $10$ fields have yields in the range $[1150, 1200)$.\n  - Adding the frequencies cumulatively:\n    - $6$ fields are below $950$.\n    - $6 + 12 = 18$ fields are below $1000$.\n    - $18 + 18 = 36$ fields are below $1050$.\n    - $36 + 24 = 60$ fields are below $1100$.\n  - The 50th and 51st fields fall in the range $[1050, 1100)$, which means the median yield is less than $1050$ kilograms.\n  - Therefore, **Option A is correct**.\n\n- **Option B:** More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms.\n  - From the cumulative frequency, only $18$ fields (out of $100$) have yields less than $1000$ kilograms.\n  - This is $18\\%$, which is much less than $80\\%$.\n  - Therefore, **Option B is incorrect**.\n\n- **Option C:** The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.\n  - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n  - The minimum yield is in the range $[900, 950)$, and the maximum yield is in the range $[1150, 1200)$.\n  - The range is approximately $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms.\n  - Therefore, **Option C is incorrect** (since the range is exactly $300$ kilograms).\n\n- **Option D:** The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.\n  - Given the distribution, the average yield is likely to be higher than $1000$ kilograms.\n  - Therefore, **Option D is incorrect**.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **Option A**.\n\n***\n\n", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 520, "output_tokens": 641, "total_tokens": 1161}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n| Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\nBased on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct? ( )\n- A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms\n- B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms\n- C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms\n- D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n1. Calculate the cumulative frequencies to find the median:\n   - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n   - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n   - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n   - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n   - $[1100, 1150)$: $60 + 18 = 78$\n   - $[1150, 1200)$: $78 + 10 = 88$\n\n   The median is the $50^{th}$ value in a sorted list of $100$ fields. Since $36$ fields have yields less than $1050$ and $60$ fields have yields less than $1100$, the median yield per acre is in the $[1050, 1100)$ range.\n\n2. Check if more than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms:\n   - $18$ fields out of $100$ have yields less than $1000$ kilograms, which is $18\\%$, not $80\\%$.\n\n3. Calculate the range of the yields:\n   - The range is from the lowest value in $[900, 950)$ to the highest value in $[1150, 1200)$.\n   - Range = $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms.\n\n4. Estimate the average yield per acre:\n   - Approximate the midpoint for each range as follows:\n     - $[900, 950)$: $925$\n     - $[950, 1000)$: $975$\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: $1025$\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: $1075$\n     - $[1100, 1150)$: $1125$\n     - $[1150, 1200)$: $1175$\n\n   - Calculate the weighted average:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 925 + 12 \\cdot 975 + 18 \\cdot 1025 + 24 \\cdot 1075 + 18 \\cdot 1125 + 10 \\cdot 1175}{100}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750}{100}\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\frac{93500}{100} = 935 \\, \\text{kilograms}\n     \\]\n\n   The average yield is not between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['A']}\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 527, "output_tokens": 869, "total_tokens": 1396}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms**\n\n  The median yield is the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data. Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values. From the frequency distribution:\n  - $6$ fields have yields in $[900, 950)$\n  - $12$ fields have yields in $[950, 1000)$\n  - $18$ fields have yields in $[1000, 1050)$\n  - $24$ fields have yields in $[1050, 1100)$\n\n  Summing these:\n  - By the first two intervals: $6 + 12 = 18$ fields (less than $1000$ kg)\n  - By the first three intervals: $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$ fields (less than $1050$ kg)\n  - By the first four intervals: $6 + 12 + 18 + 24 = 60$ fields (less than $1100$ kg)\n\n  Therefore, the $50$th and $51$st values fall in the $[1050, 1100)$ interval, making the median less than $1050$ kg.\n\n- **B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms**\n\n  As calculated:\n  - The number of fields less than $1000$ kg is $6 + 12 = 18$ fields.\n  - This is $18\\%$ of $100$ fields, which is not more than $80\\%$.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms**\n\n  The range is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n  - Minimum yield: $900$ kg\n  - Maximum yield: $1200$ kg\n  - Range: $1200 - 900 = 300$ kg, which is exactly $300$ kg and not between $200$ kg and $300$ kg.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms**\n\n  To find the average:\n  - Use the midpoints of the intervals: $925$, $975$, $1025$, $1075$, $1125$, $1175$\n  - Calculate the weighted average:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Average} = \\frac{6 \\times 925 + 12 \\times 975 + 18 \\times 1025 + 24 \\times 1075 + 18 \\times 1125 + 10 \\times 1175}{100}\n    \\]\n  - Simplifying:\n    \\[\n    \\text{Average} = \\frac{5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750}{100} = \\frac{93500}{100} = 935 \\, \\text{kg}\n    \\]\n  - The average yield is $935$ kg, which is between $900$ kg and $1000$ kg.\n\nHence, the correct answer is:\n- A.

For $100$ fields, the median is the average of the $50^{\\text{th}}$ and $51^{\\text{st}}$ values.\n   - Cumulative frequencies up to each interval:\n     - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n     - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n     - $[1100, 1150)$: $60 + 18 = 78$\n     - $[1150, 1200)$: $78 + 10 = 88$\n   - The $50^{\\text{th}}$ and $51^{\\text{st}}$ values fall within the $[1050, 1100)$ interval.\n   - Thus, the median yield per acre is between $1050$ and $1100$ kilograms.\n\n2. **Evaluate each option:**\n   - **Option A:** The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms.\n     - This is incorrect because the median falls in the $[1050, 1100)$ interval.\n   - **Option B:** More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms.\n     - The cumulative frequency up to $[950, 1000)$ is $18$, which is $18\\%$ of the fields. This is incorrect.\n   - **Option C:** The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.\n     - The minimum yield is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum yield is less than $1200$ kilograms. The range is between $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This is incorrect.\n   - **Option D:** The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.\n     - To verify, estimate the average:\n       - Use midpoints of intervals: $925, 975, 1025, 1075, 1125, 1175$.\n       - Weighted average: \n         $$\\frac{6 \\cdot 925 + 12 \\cdot 975 + 18 \\cdot 1025 + 24 \\cdot 1075 + 18 \\cdot 1125 + 10 \\cdot 1175}{100} = 105000 / 100 = 1050$$\n       - The average is estimated around $1050$ kilograms, not $900$ to $1000$ kilograms.

Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values.\n   - By summing the frequencies, we can find that the first 36 fields have yields less than 1050 kg (6 + 12 + 18 = 36).\n   - The next 24 fields (positions 37 to 60) have yields in the range [1050, 1100) kg.\n   - Therefore, the 50th and 51st values both fall into the [1050, 1100) kg range.\n\n2. **Calculate the Percentage of Fields with Yields Less than 1000 kg:**\n   - The number of fields with yields less than 1000 kg is 6 + 12 = 18.\n   - Therefore, the percentage is (18/100) * 100% = 18%.\n\n3. **Calculate the Range of Yields:**\n   - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum yields.\n   - The minimum yield is 900 kg (lower bound of the first interval).\n   - The maximum yield is 1200 kg (upper bound of the last interval).\n   - Therefore, the range is 1200 kg - 900 kg = 300 kg.\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Yield:**\n   - Since the exact yields within each range are not provided, a precise average cannot be calculated without more information.\n\nBased on the above analysis:\n- Option A is incorrect because the median yield is within [1050, 1100) kg, not less than 1050 kg.\n- Option B is incorrect because only 18% of the fields have yields less than 1000 kg.\n- Option C is incorrect because the range is 300 kg, not between 200 kg and 300 kg.\n- Option D is plausible but cannot be definitively confirmed with the given data.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['D']}\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 520, "output_tokens": 449, "total_tokens": 969}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['D']}", "llm_answer": ["D"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n1. **Calculate the Median Yield:**\n   The median is the middle value in the dataset of $100$ fields. To find the median, we need the cumulative frequency:\n   - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n   - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n   - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n   - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n   - $[1100, 1150)$: $60 + 18 = 78$\n   - $[1150, 1200)$: $78 + 10 = 88$\n\n   Since $60$ fields have a yield between $[1000, 1100)$, and the total number of fields is $100$, the median yield must be in the $[1050, 1100)$ range.\n\n2. **Calculate the Percentage of Yields Below $1000$ kg:**\n   Fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms:\n   - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n   - $[950, 1000)$: $12$\n   Total fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms = $6 + 12 = 18$\n   Percentage of fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms = $\\frac{18}{100} \\times 100\\% = 18\\%$\n\n3. **Calculate the Range of Yields:**\n   - Minimum yield: $900$ kilograms \n   - Maximum yield: $1200$ kilograms\n   Range = $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms\n\n4. **Calculate the Average Yield:**\n   We can estimate the average by using the midpoints of each yield range:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Average} \\approx \\frac{6 \\times 925 + 12 \\times 975 + 18 \\times 1025 + 24 \\times 1075 + 18 \\times 1125 + 10 \\times 1175}{100}\n   \\]\n\n   Simplifying,\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{6 \\times 925 + 12 \\times 975 + 18 \\times 1025 + 24 \\times 1075 + 18 \\times 1125 + 10 \\times 1175}{100}\n   \\]\n\n   Calculation:\n   \\[\n   = \\frac{5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750}{100}\n   = \\frac{93500}{100} = 935 \\text{ kilograms}\n   \\]\n\n   The average yield per acre is $935$ kilograms.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n- A. The median yield per acre is not less than $1050$ kilograms.\n- B. Only $18\\%$ of the fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms.\n- C. The range of yields is $300$ kilograms.\n- D. The average yield per acre is around $935$ kilograms.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['C']}", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 527, "output_tokens": 939, "total_tokens": 1466}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n1. First, determine the median yield per acre. Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values when the yields are ordered.\n2. Accumulate the frequencies:\n   - $[900, 950)$: $6$\n   - $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n   - $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n   - $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n   - $[1100, 1150)$: $60 + 18 = 78$\n   - $[1150, 1200)$: $78 + 10 = 88$\n\n   Since the $50$th and $51$st values fall within the $[1050, 1100)$ range, the median yield is in this range. Hence, statement A is incorrect since the median is not less than $1050$ kilograms.\n\n3. For statement B, calculate $80\\%$ of $100$ fields, which is $80$ fields. The cumulative frequency up to less than $1000$ kilograms is $18$, which is far less than $80$. Hence, statement B is incorrect.\n\n4. For statement C, check the range of the yields:\n   - The lowest range is $[900, 950)$, and the highest range is $[1150, 1200)$.\n   - The difference between the highest point in the range and the lowest point is $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. Hence, statement C is incorrect since the range is exactly $300$ kilograms, not between $200$ and $300$ kilograms.\n\n5. For statement D, calculate the average yield:\n   - Calculate midpoints: \n     $$ \\text{Midpoints} = [925, 975, 1025, 1075, 1125, 1175] $$\n   - Calculate weighted sum:\n     $$ 6 \\times 925 + 12 \\times 975 + 18 \\times 1025 + 24 \\times 1075 + 18 \\times 1125 + 10 \\times 1175 = 5550 + 11700 + 18450 + 25800 + 20250 + 11750 = 93550 $$\n   - Average yield:\n     $$ \\text{Average} = \\frac{93550}{100} = 935.5 \\, \\text{kilograms} $$\n   Statement D is correct since the average yield is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['D']}\n\n***", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 549, "output_tokens": 855, "total_tokens": 1404}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['D']}", "llm_answer": ["D"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Since we have $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ values.\n\n  From the frequency table:\n  - $[900, 950)$: $6$ fields\n  - $[950, 1000)$: $12$ fields (Cumulative: $6 + 12 = 18$ fields)\n  - $[1000, 1050)$: $18$ fields (Cumulative: $18 + 18 = 36$ fields)\n  - $[1050, 1100)$: $24$ fields (Cumulative: $36 + 24 = 60$ fields)\n\n  The $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ fields lie within the interval $[1050, 1100)$. Therefore, the median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms, which makes option A correct.\n\n- B. **More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n  From the frequency table:\n  - $[900, 950)$: $6$ fields\n  - $[950, 1000)$: $12$ fields\n\n  Together, $6 + 12 = 18$ fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms, which is only $18\\%$ of the $100$ fields. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\n- C. **The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.**\n\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n  \n  Minimum yield is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum yield is at most $1200$ kilograms. \n\n  So, the range is $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms, making the range exactly $300$ kilograms, not between $200$ and $300$ kilograms. Thus, option C is incorrect.\n\n- D. **The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n  Based on the intervals and frequencies, the average yield would likely be closer to the middle of the data distribution, which spans from $900$ to $1200$. This makes it implausible for the average to be as low as $900$ to $1000$ kilograms.

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n### Solution Process\n\n1. **Determine the median yield per acre:**\n   - The median is the value that separates the higher half from the lower half. Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ values.\n   - To find these values, we need to locate the intervals that include them:\n     - The first $6$ fields have yields in $[900, 950)$.\n     - The next $12$ fields have yields in $[950, 1000)$, so the first $18$ fields have yields below $1000$.\n     - The following $18$ fields have yields in $[1000, 1050)$, making a total of $36$ fields below $1050$.\n     - The next $24$ fields have yields in $[1050, 1100)$, making it up to $60$ fields below $1100$.\n     - Therefore, the $50^{th}$ and $51^{st}$ values are in the interval $[1050, 1100)$.\n   - Thus, the median yield per acre is in the interval $[1050, 1100)$, which is more than $1050$ kilograms.\n\n2. **Evaluate each option:**\n   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The median yield per acre is more than $1050$ kilograms.\n   - **Option B**: Incorrect. Less than $80\\%$ ($80$ fields) of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms ($18$ fields are below $1000$ kilograms).\n   - **Option C**: Correct. The range of yields is from $[900, 950)$ to $[1150, 1200)$, so the maximum range is $1150 - 900 = 250$ kilograms, which is between $200$ and $300$ kilograms.\n   - **Option D**: Incorrect.

The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n   | Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n   | Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\n   Based on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct? ( )\n   - A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms\n   - B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms\n   - C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms\n   - D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms"}, "result": "## Part I: Multiple Choice Questions\n\n### Question 4\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['A']}\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\nTo determine which conclusion is correct based on the given data, we need to evaluate each option:\n\n1. **Option A: The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms.**\n\n   - The median of a data set is the middle value when the data points are ordered in ascending order.\n   - Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values.\n   - The frequency distribution has been given as follows:\n     - $[900, 950)$: $6$ fields\n     - $[950, 1000)$: $12$ fields\n     - $[1000, 1050)$: $18$ fields\n     - $[1050, 1100)$: $24$ fields\n     - $[1100, 1150)$: $18$ fields\n     - $[1150, 1200)$: $10$ fields\n   - To find the median, we need to locate the $50$th and $51$st field.\n     - The cumulative frequency up to $[1000, 1050)$ is $6 + 12 = 18$.\n     - The cumulative frequency up to $[1050, 1100)$ is $18 + 18 = 36$.\n     - The cumulative frequency up to $[1050, 1100)$ is $36 + 24 = 60$.\n   - Since the $50$th and $51$st values fall into the interval $[1050, 1100)$, the median yield per acre is in the range $[1050, 1100)$, indicating that the $50$th and $51$st yields are indeed in this interval.\n\n2. **Option B: More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n   - To determine this, we need to calculate the percentage of fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms.\n   - The cumulative frequency up to the interval $[950, 1000)$ is $6 + 12 = 18$.\n   - $18$ fields out of $100$ have yields less than $1000$ kilograms.\n   - $18\\%$ of the fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms, which is not more than $80\\%$. So, this option is incorrect.\n\n3. **Option C: The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.**\n\n   - The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset.\n   - The data spans from $[900, 950)$ to $[1150, 1200)$, so the range is $1150 - 900 = 250$ kilograms.\n   - The option states the range is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms, which is correct. But upon closer inspection of the intervals, the span of $[900, 1200]$ indicates $300$ kilograms and not actually $250$, so this needs to be considered more precisely.\n\n4. **Option D: The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.**\n\n   - To find the average, we need to calculate the midpoint of each interval and then use the frequency to find the weighted average.\n   - Midpoints: $(900 + 950)/2 = 925$, $(950 + 1000)/2 = 975$, $(1000 + 1050)/2 = 1025$, $(1050 + 1100)/2 = 1075$, $(1100 + 1150)/2 = 1125$, $(1150 + 1200)/2 = 1175$.\n   - Weighted average calculation:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Average} = \\frac{925 \\times 6 + 975 \\times 12 + 1025 \\times 18 + 1075 \\times 24 + 1125 \\times 18 + 1175 \\times 10}{100} \\approx 1059\n     \\]\n   - The average yield is approximately $1059$ kilograms, which is not between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms. So, this option is incorrect.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the correct conclusion is given in option A.\n\n***\n\n", "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 520, "output_tokens": 963, "total_tokens": 1483}, "infer_time(s)": null, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}
