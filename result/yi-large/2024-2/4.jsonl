An agricultural research department planted new rice varieties in $100$ equal-sized fields and recorded the per acre yield (in kilograms) for each field. The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n   | Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n   | Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\n   Based on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct?

The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms\n   - D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the given data.\n\n- **Median**: The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the first three categories ($[900, 950)$, $[950, 1000)$, and $[1000, 1050)$) account for 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 fields. The next category ($[1050, 1100)$) has 24 fields, so the 50th and 51st values will fall within this category, making the median less than 1100 kilograms. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n- **Percentage of fields with yield less than 1000 kilograms**: The first two categories ($[900, 950)$ and $[950, 1000)$) account for 6 + 12 = 18 fields, which is less than 20% of the total. Thus, more than 80% of the fields have yields per acre greater than or equal to 1000 kilograms, making option B incorrect.\n\n- **Range**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is at least 900 kilograms, and the maximum yield is less than 1200 kilograms. Thus, the range is less than 300 kilograms, making option C incorrect.\n\n- **Average (Mean)**: To find the average, we would need the exact values within each category, which we don't have. However, we can estimate. The middle value of each category can be used as a rough estimate for the values within that category. This would give us an estimated total yield, which we could divide by 100 to get an average. Without calculating the exact average, we can see that the data is skewed towards the higher end, with more fields having yields above 1000 kilograms. This makes option D plausible, but without exact calculations, we cannot confirm it.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the provided options can be confirmed as correct based on the given data and without further calculations.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n\n{'4': ['None of the above']}\n\n***\n\nNote: The answer provided is based on the given data and the analysis conducted.

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the given frequency distribution table.\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms:**\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values. From the table, we can see that the first three classes contain $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$ fields, and the fourth class contains $24$ fields. Therefore, the $50$th and $51$st values fall in the fourth class, which is $[1050, 1100)$. Thus, the median is less than $1100$ kilograms, but we cannot determine if it is less than $1050$ kilograms without more specific data within the classes.\n\n- **B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms:**\n  To check this, we calculate the percentage of fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms. The first two classes contain $6 + 12 = 18$ fields. So, $18$ out of $100$ fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms, which is $18\\%$ and not more than $80\\%$.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms:**\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum is in the interval $[900, 950)$, and the maximum is in the interval $[1150, 1200)$. Even considering the lower bound of the maximum and the upper bound of the minimum, the range is $1150 - 950 = 200$ kilograms, which is the lower bound of the given range.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms:**\n  To check this, we would need to calculate the average. However, without the exact values within each class, we cannot accurately calculate the average. But we can observe that the majority of the fields (specifically, $6 + 12 + 18 + 24 = 60$ fields) have yields in the range $[900, 1100)$, which suggests that the average could be in this range, but we cannot confirm it without more specific data.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most certain conclusion based on the available data is related to the range of the yields, which is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms, making option C the correct answer.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n\n{'4': ['C']}", "infer_time(s)": 50.41488, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms:**\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the first three categories ($[900, 950)$, $[950, 1000)$, and $[1000, 1050)$) account for 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 fields. The next category, $[1050, 1100)$, has 24 fields, which means the 50th and 51st values fall within this category. Therefore, the median is less than 1100 kilograms, making this statement correct.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms:**\n  To check this, we add the frequencies of the first two categories ($[900, 950)$ and $[950, 1000)$), which is 6 + 12 = 18 fields. This is less than 80% of 100 fields (which would be 80 fields). Therefore, this statement is incorrect.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms:**\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum is at least 900 kilograms, and the maximum is at most 1199 kilograms (since it's in the $[1150, 1200)$ category). The range is thus at most 1199 - 900 = 299 kilograms, which is less than 300 kilograms but not necessarily between 200 and 300 kilograms without more specific data. Therefore, we cannot definitively say this statement is correct based on the given information.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms:**\n  To find the average, we would need to know the midpoint of each category and multiply it by the frequency, then divide by the total number of fields. Without the specific midpoints, we cannot accurately calculate the average. Therefore, we cannot confirm this statement based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion is A.

An agricultural research department planted new rice varieties in $100$ equal-sized fields and recorded the per acre yield (in kilograms) for each field. The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n   | Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n   | Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\n   Based on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct?

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms**\n  \n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the cumulative frequency up to the interval $[1050, 1100)$ is $6 + 12 + 18 + 24 = 60$. This means that the $50$th and $51$st values fall within this interval, making the median less than $1100$ kilograms. However, we cannot definitively say it is less than $1050$ kilograms without more specific data within the intervals.\n\n- **B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms**\n  \n  To check this, we calculate the cumulative frequency up to the interval $[950, 1000)$. It is $6 + 12 = 18$, which is only $18\\%$ of the total fields, not more than $80\\%$.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms**\n  \n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The minimum possible yield is just above $900$ kilograms, and the maximum possible yield is just below $1200$ kilograms. Thus, the range is between $300$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms, which is within the given range.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms**\n  \n  Without the exact yields within each interval, we cannot accurately calculate the average. However, we can estimate that the average would likely be above $900$ kilograms given the distribution, but we cannot confirm it is below $1000$ kilograms without more specific data.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n\n{'4': ['C']}\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo arrive at the correct conclusion, we systematically evaluated each option against the data provided in the table:\n\n- **A.** We determined that while the median is likely less than $1100$ kilograms, we cannot definitively say it is less than $1050$ kilograms without more specific data within the intervals.\n  \n- **B.** We calculated the cumulative frequency up to the interval $[950, 1000)$ and found it to be only $18\\%$, not more than $80\\%$.\n  \n- **C.** We calculated the range based on the minimum and maximum possible yields and found it to be between $300$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms, which is within the given range.\n  \n- **D.** We concluded that without the exact yields within each interval, we cannot accurately calculate the average, and therefore, cannot confirm this statement.\n\nThus, the correct conclusion is **C.** The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.", "infer_time(s)": 49.47429, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the information provided in the table. The table shows the frequency distribution of the yield per acre for the 100 fields. We can calculate the cumulative frequency to find the median class, the range, and the average yield per acre.\n\n#### Median:\nTo find the median class, we first calculate the cumulative frequency:\n\n- For the class $[900, 950)$, the cumulative frequency is $6$.\n- For the class $[950, 1000)$, the cumulative frequency is $6 + 12 = 18$.\n- For the class $[1000, 1050)$, the cumulative frequency is $18 + 18 = 36$.\n- For the class $[1050, 1100)$, the cumulative frequency is $36 + 24 = 60$.\n- For the class $[1100, 1150)$, the cumulative frequency is $60 + 18 = 78$.\n- For the class $[1150, 1200)$, the cumulative frequency is $78 + 10 = 88$.\n\nSince there are 100 fields, the median class is the class containing the 50th and 51st observations. The cumulative frequency shows that the median class is $[1050, 1100)$, which means the median yield per acre is in this range. This supports conclusion A.\n\n#### Range:\nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is in the class $[900, 950)$, and the maximum yield is in the class $[1150, 1200)$. The range is thus between $1150 - 900 = 250$ kilograms and $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This does not support conclusion C.\n\n#### Average (Mean):\nTo estimate the average yield per acre, we can use the midpoint of each class and its frequency. However, without the exact values within each class, we cannot accurately calculate the mean. The table only provides a rough distribution, not the exact data points needed for a precise mean calculation. Therefore, we cannot definitively support or refute conclusion D based on the given information.\n\n#### More than 80% of the fields:\nTo determine if more than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms, we look at the cumulative frequency for the class just before 1000 kilograms. The cumulative frequency for the class $[950, 1000)$ is 18, which is less than 80% of 100 fields (80 fields). This does not support conclusion B.\n\n### Answer\n\nBased on the analysis:\n\n- Conclusion A is correct because the median yield per acre for the 100 fields is in the class $[1050, 1100)$, which is less than 1100 kilograms.\n- Conclusion B is incorrect because less than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms.\n- Conclusion C is incorrect because the range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 250 kilograms and 300 kilograms, not between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms.\n- Conclusion D cannot be definitively supported or refuted without more specific data on the yields within each class.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n```\n{'4': ['A']}\n```", "infer_time(s)": 37.54032, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms:**\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have 100 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the first three classes ([900, 950), [950, 1000), [1000, 1050)) account for a total of 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 fields. The next class ([1050, 1100)) has 24 fields, which means the 50th and 51st values fall within this class. Therefore, the median is less than 1100 kilograms, but we cannot determine if it is less than 1050 kilograms without more specific information within the [1050, 1100) class.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms:**\n  To test this statement, we sum the frequencies of the classes below 1000 kilograms: 6 (for [900, 950)) + 12 (for [950, 1000)) = 18 fields. This is out of 100 fields, so 18/100 = 18%, which is far less than 80%. This statement is incorrect.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms:**\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

So, the range is at most 1199 - 900 = 299 kilograms, which is between 200 and 300 kilograms. This statement is correct.\n\n- **D.

Since we have 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. \n\n  Let's find the cumulative frequency to determine where the median lies:\n\n  | Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n  | Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n  | Cumulative Frequency | $6$ | $18$ | $36$ | $60$ | $78$ | $88$ |\n\n  From the cumulative frequency, we can see that the 50th and 51st values fall within the interval $[1050, 1100)$, which means the median yield per acre is less than 1100 kilograms. Since the median is less than 1100 kilograms, it is also less than 1050 kilograms. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\n- **Percentage of Fields with Yield Less Than 1000 Kilograms**: The total number of fields with yield less than 1000 kilograms is $6 + 12 = 18$. As a percentage of the total 100 fields, this is $18\\%$, which is not more than $80\\%$. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n- **Range of Yields**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is in the interval $[900, 950)$, and the maximum yield is in the interval $[1150, 1200)$. Therefore, the range is between $1150 - 900 = 250$ kilograms and $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. However, since the exact minimum and maximum values within these intervals are not provided, we cannot accurately determine if the range is strictly between $200$ and $300$ kilograms. Therefore, option C is not necessarily correct based on the information given.\n\n- **Average Yield**: To calculate the average, we would need the exact yields within each interval and the frequency of each yield within those intervals. Since we only have the intervals and their frequencies, we cannot accurately calculate the average yield. Therefore, option D cannot be confirmed or denied based on the information provided.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion is A. The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms.", "infer_time(s)": 32.29788, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, let's analyze each statement:\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms:**\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values. From the table, we see that the first three intervals contain 36 fields, and the fourth interval contains 24 fields. Thus, the median is in the fourth interval, $[1050, 1100)$. Since the interval is open on the left, the median could be less than or equal to 1050 kg, but since we've already accounted for 60 fields with yields less than 1050 kg, the median must be greater than 1050 kg. Therefore, statement A is incorrect.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms:**\n  To test this statement, we sum the frequencies of the first three intervals: $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$. This means 36 out of 100 fields have yields less than 1000 kg, which is 36%, far less than the 80% claimed. Therefore, statement B is incorrect.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms:**\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum is at least 900 kg, and the maximum is at most 1199 kg (since it's in the $[1150, 1200)$ interval). Thus, the range is at most $1199 - 900 = 299$ kg, which is indeed between 200 kg and 300 kg. Therefore, statement C is correct.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms:**\n  Without the exact data points, we cannot accurately calculate the average. However, we can estimate. The midpoints of the intervals are approximately $925, 975, 1025, 1075, 1125, 1175$ kg, respectively. Taking a weighted average with the frequencies gives a rough estimate, but without calculating, we can see that the distribution is skewed towards the higher end, likely making the average greater than 1000 kg. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n\n{'4': ['C']}", "infer_time(s)": 43.53294, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

Original Problem\n\nAn agricultural research department planted new rice varieties in $100$ equal-sized fields and recorded the per acre yield (in kilograms) for each field. The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n\n| Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\nBased on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct? ( )\n- A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms\n- B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms\n- C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms\n- D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the given data.\n\n- **Median Yield**: The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the first $36$ fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms, and the next $18$ fields have yields between $1000$ and $1050$ kilograms. This means the $50$th and $51$st fields will fall in the $[1000, 1050)$ interval, making the median yield per acre less than $1050$ kilograms. **Conclusion A is correct.**\n\n- **Percentage of Fields with Yield Less Than $1000$ Kilograms**: The first two intervals, $[900, 950)$ and $[950, 1000)$, account for $18$ fields. This is $18\\%$ of the total $100$ fields, which is far less than the $80\\%$ mentioned in option B. **Conclusion B is incorrect.**\n\n- **Range of Yields**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum yield is less than $1200$ kilograms. Thus, the range is less than $300$ kilograms but not necessarily between $200$ and $300$ kilograms, as we don't have the exact minimum and maximum values. **Conclusion C is not necessarily correct.**\n\n- **Average Yield**: To calculate the average, we would need the exact yields within each interval and the frequency of each interval. Without this information, we cannot accurately determine the average yield. **Conclusion D cannot be confirmed with the given data.**\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n\n{'4': ['A']}", "infer_time(s)": 39.76716, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms**:\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the first three categories ($[900, 950)$, $[950, 1000)$, and $[1000, 1050)$) account for 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 fields. The next category, $[1050, 1100)$, has 24 fields, so the 50th and 51st values will fall within this category, making the median less than 1050 kilograms.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms**:\n  To check this, we calculate the percentage of fields with yields less than 1000 kilograms. The first two categories account for 6 + 12 = 18 fields. So, 18 out of 100 fields have yields less than 1000 kilograms, which is 18%, not more than 80%.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms**:\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is at least 900 kilograms, and the maximum yield is at most 1199 kilograms (since it's in the $[1150, 1200)$ category but not exceeding 1200). So, the range is at most 1199 - 900 = 299 kilograms, which is not between 200 and 300 kilograms.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms**:\n  Without the exact data points, we cannot accurately calculate the average. However, even if we were to take the midpoint of each category and multiply it by the frequency, then divide by the total number of fields, it's clear that the average would be skewed higher because of the higher frequencies in the categories above 1000 kilograms.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is **A. The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms**.", "infer_time(s)": 41.59534, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n\nTo find the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms**\n\nThe median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the first three categories ($[900, 950)$, $[950, 1000)$, and $[1000, 1050)$) account for $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$ fields. The next category, $[1050, 1100)$, has $24$ fields, which means the $50$th and $51$st fields fall within this category. Therefore, the median yield per acre is indeed less than $1050$ kilograms.\n\n- **B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms**\n\nTo check this, we add up the frequencies of the first three categories: $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$. This is only $36\\%$ of the fields, not more than $80\\%$.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms**\n\nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum is at most $1199$ kilograms (since it's in the $[1150, 1200)$ category). The range is thus between $200$ and $300$ kilograms, which is not correct; the range is actually $299$ kilograms at most.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms**\n\nWithout the exact yields within each category, we cannot accurately calculate the average. However, since the majority of the fields are in the higher yield categories, it's likely that the average is above $1000$ kilograms.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n\n{'4': ['A']}\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms**\n\nTo find the median, we look for the middle value(s) in the ordered data set. With $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values. From the table, we can see that the first three categories account for $36$ fields, and the next category has $24$ fields. This means the $50$th and $51$st fields fall within the $[1050, 1100)$ category, which confirms that the median is indeed less than $1050$ kilograms.\n\n- **B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms**\n\nThis conclusion is not supported by the data. The first three categories account for only $36\\%$ of the fields, which is far from the claimed $80\\%$.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms**\n\nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The minimum is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum is at most $1199$ kilograms. Therefore, the range is $1199 - 900 = 299$ kilograms, which does not fit the given range of $200$ to $300$ kilograms.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms**\n\nWithout the exact yields within each category, we cannot calculate the average precisely. However, given the distribution, it's likely that the average is above $1000$ kilograms, making this conclusion less likely to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion based on the data provided is that the median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms.", "infer_time(s)": 62.71651, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The table shows the frequency distribution of the yield per acre for 100 fields. We can calculate the cumulative frequency to determine the median class, the range, and the average yield per acre.\n\n1. **Median Calculation**:\n   - The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted.\n   - Cumulative frequency calculation:\n     - Up to $[950, 1000)$: $6 + 12 = 18$\n     - Up to $[1000, 1050)$: $18 + 18 = 36$\n     - Up to $[1050, 1100)$: $36 + 24 = 60$\n     - Since the median position is between 50 and 51, the median class is $[1050, 1100)$.\n   - This means the median yield per acre is less than 1100 kilograms but not necessarily less than 1050 kilograms. So, option A is not necessarily correct.\n\n2. **Percentage of Fields with Yield Less Than 1000 Kilograms**:\n   - The cumulative frequency up to the class before $[1000, 1050)$ is $18$.\n   - The percentage of fields with yield less than 1000 kilograms is $\\frac{18}{100} \\times 100\\% = 18\\%$.\n   - This is not more than $80\\%$, so option B is incorrect.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**:\n   - The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values.\n   - The lowest class is $[900, 950)$, and the highest class is $[1150, 1200)$.\n   - The range is approximately $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms.\n   - This confirms that the range is between 200 and 300 kilograms, so option C is correct.\n\n4. **Average Yield Calculation**:\n   - To calculate the average, we would need the midpoint of each class and the frequency. However, without the exact midpoints, we cannot precisely calculate the average.\n   - Nonetheless, a rough estimate can be made by considering the class marks (midpoints of the classes) and multiplying by the frequency, then dividing by the total number of fields. This would likely fall between 900 and 1200 kilograms, but without specific calculations, we cannot confirm option D.\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['C']}", "infer_time(s)": 29.79772, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms**:\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the first three classes ([900, 950), [950, 1000), [1000, 1050)) contain 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 fields, which is less than 50. The next class ([1050, 1100)) contains 24 fields, which means the 50th and 51st values fall within this class. Therefore, the median is less than 1100 kilograms, but we cannot conclude it is less than 1050 kilograms without more specific information within the [1050, 1100) class.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms**:\n  To test this statement, we calculate the cumulative frequency up to the class before 1000 kilograms, which is the [950, 1000) class. The cumulative frequency up to this point is 6 + 12 = 18 fields. Since we have 100 fields in total, this represents 18/100 = 18% of the fields, which is not more than 80%.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms**:\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is at least 900 kilograms, and the maximum yield is less than 1200 kilograms. Therefore, the range is less than 300 kilograms but could be as low as 300 kilograms if the minimum value is exactly 900 kilograms and the maximum value is just below 1200 kilograms.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms**:\n  To estimate the average, we can take the midpoint of each class and multiply it by the frequency, then divide by the total number of fields. However, without the exact midpoints, we can only roughly estimate. Since the majority of the fields are in the higher yield classes, the average is likely to be above 1000 kilograms.\n\n### Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the only statement we can confidently conclude is correct is:\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms**.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n```\n{'4': ['C']}\n```", "infer_time(s)": 35.08956, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the given frequency distribution table.\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms:**\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values. From the table, we can see that the first three intervals contain $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$ fields, and the fourth interval contains $24$ fields. Therefore, the $50$th and $51$st values fall within the fourth interval, which is $[1050, 1100)$. Thus, the median is less than $1100$ kilograms but not necessarily less than $1050$ kilograms. This conclusion is not necessarily correct.\n\n- **B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms:**\n  The first two intervals, $[900, 950)$ and $[950, 1000)$, contain $6 + 12 = 18$ fields. This is $18\\%$ of the total $100$ fields, which is far from the $80\\%$ claimed. This conclusion is incorrect.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms:**\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum is at most $1199$ kilograms (since it's in the $[1150, 1200)$ interval). Therefore, the range is between $1199 - 900 = 299$ kilograms and $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This conclusion is correct.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms:**\n  To find the average, we would need to know the midpoint of each interval and the total yield. We can estimate that the average is likely to be above $900$ kilograms since the majority of the fields have yields in the higher intervals. However, without more specific information, we cannot accurately calculate the average from the given table to confirm if it is between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms. This conclusion is not necessarily correct without further calculation.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n\n{'4': ['C']}", "infer_time(s)": 46.54004, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the information provided in the table.\n\n- **Median**: The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have $100$ data points, the median will be the average of the $50th$ and $51st$ values when sorted.\n  \n  Let's find the cumulative frequency to determine where the median lies:\n  \n  | Yield per acre | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |\n  | --- | --- | --- |\n  | $[900, 950)$ | $6$ | $6$ |\n  | $[950, 1000)$ | $12$ | $18$ |\n  | $[1000, 1050)$ | $18$ | $36$ |\n  | $[1050, 1100)$ | $24$ | $60$ |\n  | $[1100, 1150)$ | $18$ | $78$ |\n  | $[1150, 1200)$ | $10$ | $88$ |\n\n  Since the cumulative frequency jumps from $36$ to $60$ between the intervals $[1000, 1050)$ and $[1050, 1100)$, the median must lie in the interval $[1050, 1100)$. Therefore, the median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1100$ kilograms but not necessarily less than $1050$ kilograms. **Conclusion A is not necessarily correct.**\n\n- **Percentage of fields with yield less than $1000$ kilograms**: From the cumulative frequency table, we see that $18$ fields have yields in the interval $[900, 950)$, and $12$ fields have yields in the interval $[950, 1000)$. Therefore, $30$ fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms, which is $30\\%$ of the total fields, not more than $80\\%$. **Conclusion B is incorrect.**\n\n- **Range**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum yield is less than $1200$ kilograms. Therefore, the range is less than $300$ kilograms but not necessarily between $200$ and $300$ kilograms. We don't have enough information to determine the exact range. **Conclusion C cannot be confirmed with the given information.**\n\n- **Average (Mean)**: To calculate the average, we would need the midpoint of each class interval and the frequency. However, without the exact values within each interval, we cannot accurately calculate the average. **Conclusion D cannot be confirmed without additional information.**\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['E']}  \n\nThe correct answer is 'E', indicating that none of the given conclusions are correct based on the information provided.", "infer_time(s)": 49.11296, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['E']}", "llm_answer": ["E"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms.\n- C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms.\n- D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms.\n\nGiven the information in the table, we can calculate the cumulative frequencies to determine the median and the range, and we can estimate the average yield to evaluate the options.\n\n**{'4': ['A']}**\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\n- **Median Calculation:**\nTo find the median, we need to determine the middle value when the data is sorted. With $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values when sorted.\n\nFrom the table, we can calculate the cumulative frequencies:\n- Up to $950$ kg: $6$ fields\n- Up to $1000$ kg: $6 + 12 = 18$ fields\n- Up to $1050$ kg: $18 + 18 = 36$ fields\n- Up to $1100$ kg: $36 + 24 = 60$ fields\n- Up to $1150$ kg: $60 + 18 = 78$ fields\n- Up to $1200$ kg: $78 + 10 = 88$ fields\n\nSince the $50$th and $51$st values fall within the $[1050, 1100)$ interval, the median yield per acre is less than $1050$ kilograms. This confirms option A.\n\n- **Percentage Calculation:**\nTo determine if more than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms, we look at the cumulative frequency up to $1000$ kg, which is $18$. Since $18$ out of $100$ fields is $18\\%$, it's clear that not more than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms. This eliminates option B.\n\n- **Range Calculation:**\nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is in the interval $[900, 950)$, and the maximum yield is in the interval $[1150, 1200)$. Taking the upper bound of the minimum interval and the lower bound of the maximum interval to be conservative, we get a range of $1150 - 950 = 200$ kilograms. This is not between $200$ and $300$ kilograms as required by option C, so we eliminate option C.\n\n- **Average Estimation:**\nWhile we don't have the exact data points to calculate the average precisely, we can estimate it by considering the midpoints of the intervals and their frequencies. However, without calculating it exactly, we can see that the distribution is fairly spread out, and just by observing the frequencies and intervals, it's not immediately clear that the average would fall between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms. This doesn't confirm or deny option D based on our quick analysis, but since we've already confirmed option A, we don't need to further analyze option D.\n\nGiven our analysis, the correct conclusion is A: The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms.", "infer_time(s)": 58.57202, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

An agricultural research department planted new rice varieties in $100$ equal-sized fields and recorded the per acre yield (in kilograms) for each field. The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n   | Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n   | Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\n   Based on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct?

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the given data.\n\n- A. To find the median, we need to determine the middle value(s) when the data is sorted. Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the first 36 fields have yields less than 1000 kg, and the next 18 fields have yields between 1000 and 1050 kg. This means the 50th and 51st values will be in the $[1000, 1050)$ interval, making the median less than 1050 kg.\n\n- B. To determine the percentage of fields with yields less than 1000 kg, we add the frequencies of the first three intervals: $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$. This is 36% of the total, which is not more than 80%.\n\n- C. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The minimum is at least 900 kg, and the maximum is less than 1200 kg. So, the range is less than $1200 - 900 = 300$ kg but not necessarily between 200 and 300 kg.\n\n- D. To estimate the average, we would need the midpoint of each interval and the total yield, which we don't have. However, without calculating, we can't definitively say the average is between 900 and 1000 kg.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n\n{'4': ['A']}\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\n- **Median Calculation**: Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values. The cumulative frequency up to the interval $[1000, 1050)$ is $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$. The next interval, $[1000, 1050)$, has a frequency of 18, so the 50th and 51st values will be within this interval, making the median less than 1050 kg.\n\n- **Percentage Calculation**: The percentage of fields with yields less than 1000 kg is $\\frac{36}{100} = 36\\%$, which is not more than 80%.\n\n- **Range Calculation**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Without knowing the exact distribution within each interval, we can only say the range is less than $1200 - 900 = 300$ kg.\n\n- **Average Estimation**: Without the exact data points or the midpoints of each interval and their total yield, we can't accurately calculate or estimate the average.\n\nTherefore, the correct conclusion is A, as it is the only one for which we have enough information to definitively determine its correctness based on the data provided.", "infer_time(s)": 51.37512, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the information provided in the table.\n\n- **Median Yield**: The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the frequencies up to and including the interval $[1000, 1050)$ sum to $6+12+18=36$. This means that the 50th and 51st values fall within this interval, making the median yield per acre for the 100 fields greater than or equal to 1000 kilograms. Thus, option A is incorrect.\n\n- **Percentage of Fields with Yield Less Than 1000 kg**: To find the percentage of fields with a yield less than 1000 kilograms, we sum the frequencies of the first two intervals: $6+12=18$. This means 18 out of 100 fields have yields less than 1000 kilograms, which is 18%. Therefore, it is not true that more than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms, and option B is incorrect.\n\n- **Range of Yields**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is in the interval $[900, 950)$, and the maximum yield is in the interval $[1150, 1200)$. Taking the upper bound of the minimum interval (950 kg) and the lower bound of the maximum interval (1150 kg), the range is $1150 - 950 = 200$ kilograms. Therefore, the range is indeed between 200 kg and 300 kg, making option C correct.\n\n- **Average Yield**: Without the exact data points, we cannot precisely calculate the average yield. However, we can estimate it by finding the midpoint of each interval and multiplying it by the frequency, then dividing by the total number of fields (100). This would give us an approximation, but without calculating it, we cannot definitively say the average yield is between 900 kg and 1000 kg. Thus, option D is not necessarily correct based on the information given.\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['C']}", "infer_time(s)": 25.88983, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms:**\nThe median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values. From the table, we can see that the first three classes ([900, 950), [950, 1000), [1000, 1050)) contain 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 fields, which is less than half of the total. The next class ([1050, 1100)) contains 24 fields, which means the middle values (50th and 51st) will fall in this class. Thus, the median is less than 1100 kilograms, but we cannot conclude it is less than 1050 kilograms without more specific information within the [1050, 1100) class.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms:**\nTo check this, we calculate the cumulative frequency up to the class before 1000 kilograms, which is the sum of the frequencies for the first two classes: 6 + 12 = 18. This is out of 100 fields, so 18/100 = 0.18, or 18%, which is far less than 80%. This conclusion is incorrect.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms:**\nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum is in the class starting at 900 kilograms, and the maximum is in the class starting at 1150 kilograms. Without knowing the exact minimum and maximum values within these classes, we can't determine the exact range, but it's clear that the range is at least 1150 - 900 = 250 kilograms, which is outside the given range of 200 to 300 kilograms. This conclusion is incorrect.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms:**\nTo estimate the average, we would need to calculate a weighted average using the midpoints of each class and their frequencies. However, without doing the exact calculation, we can see that the majority of the frequencies are in the classes between 950 and 1100 kilograms, which suggests an average higher than 900 kilograms. Given the distribution, it's plausible that the average could be just over 1000 kilograms, but without the exact calculation, we can't definitively say it's under 1000 kilograms. This conclusion is somewhat plausible but not guaranteed based on the information given.\n\nGiven the analysis, none of the conclusions can be definitively confirmed based on the information provided. However, if we had to choose one based on the available information, the most plausible might be D, as it is the least incorrect based on the distribution trend.\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['D']}", "infer_time(s)": 34.96355, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['D']}", "llm_answer": ["D"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms.**\n  To find the median, we need to determine the middle value when the yields are ordered. There are 100 fields, so the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when ordered. From the table, we can see that the frequencies up to and including the interval $[1050, 1100)$ account for $6+12+18+24 = 60$ fields. Since the next interval ($[1050, 1100)$) contains 24 fields, the 50th and 51st values both fall within this interval. Therefore, the median yield per acre is indeed less than 1050 kilograms.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms.**\n  The cumulative frequency up to the interval $[1000, 1050)$ is $6+12+18 = 36$, which is only 36% of the fields.

The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms.**\n  Without the exact data points, we cannot accurately calculate the average yield. However, since the median (which is often close to the average for reasonably symmetric distributions) is less than 1050 kilograms and given the distribution, it is not safe to conclude that the average is strictly between 900 and 1000 kilograms.

( )\n   - A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms\n   - B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms\n   - C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms\n   - D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms"}, "result": "## 4\n\n### Answer\n{\"4\": [\"D\"]}\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the information provided in the table.\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms:**\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have 100 data points, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the first three classes ($[900, 950)$, $[950, 1000)$, and $[1000, 1050)$) account for 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 fields, which means the median will fall in the $[1000, 1050)$ class, making this statement possibly correct but not necessarily always true based on the information given.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms:**\n  The statement can be quickly verified by checking the cumulative frequency up to the class before 1000 kg. The cumulative frequency up to the $[950, 1000)$ class is 6 + 12 = 18, which is only 18% of the total, making this statement false.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms:**\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is at least 900 kg, and the maximum yield is less than 1200 kg. Thus, the range is less than 300 kg, making this statement false.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms:**\n  To estimate the average, we can take the midpoint of each class and multiply it by the frequency, then divide by the total number of fields. This will give us an approximation of the average yield. Since the majority of the frequencies are in the $[1000, 1100)$ and $[1050, 1100)$ classes, it's reasonable to conclude that the average yield will be between 900 and 1000 kg, making this statement the most likely to be correct.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate conclusion based on the data provided is **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms.**", "infer_time(s)": 30.90941, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{\"4\": [\"D\"]}", "llm_answer": ["D"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

An agricultural research department planted new rice varieties in 100 equal-sized fields and recorded the per acre yield (in kilograms) for each field. The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n\n| Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Frequency | 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 18 | 10 |\n\nBased on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct?

The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the given data:\n\n- **Median**: The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted.\n- **Percentage below 1000 kilograms**: To find the percentage of fields with yields below 1000 kilograms, we sum the frequencies of the first two classes.\n- **Range**: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. From the table, the lowest is 900 kilograms and the highest is 1200 kilograms.\n- **Average**: The average cannot be precisely calculated from the table without knowing the exact values within each class interval.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n- A. The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms. The cumulative frequency up to the interval $[1000, 1050)$ is $6+12+18=36$. Since the median is between the 50th and 51st values, and we have counted only 36 values, the median must be in the interval $[1000, 1050)$, which makes this statement correct.\n- B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms. The cumulative frequency for yields less than 1000 kilograms is $6+12=18$, which is 18% of the fields, not more than 80%. This statement is incorrect.\n- C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms. The range is calculated by subtracting the lowest value from the highest value, which gives $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This statement is correct.\n- D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms. Without the exact values within each class interval, we cannot precisely calculate the average.

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, let's analyze each statement using the data provided in the table:\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms**:\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have $100$ data points, the median will be the average of the $50th$ and $51st$ values. From the table, we can see that the frequencies up to the interval $[1050, 1100)$ total $42 (6+12+18+24+18)$, which means the median is in this interval or lower. Thus, the median is indeed less than $1050$ kilograms.\n\n- **B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms**:\n  To test this statement, we calculate the percentage of fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms. The total frequency of fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms is $36 (6+12+18)$. The percentage is $\\frac{36}{100} = 36\\%$, which is not more than $80\\%$.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms**:\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum is less than $1200$ kilograms. Thus, the range is less than $300$ kilograms but more than $200$ kilograms, as it's between $900$ and $1200$ kilograms.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms**:\n  To calculate the average, we would need the exact yields within each interval and their frequencies. Without this information, we cannot accurately determine the average. However, this statement seems plausible given the distribution, but without specific data points within each interval, we cannot confirm it based solely on the table.\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['A']}", "infer_time(s)": 31.1513, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when the data is sorted. From the frequency table, we can see that the first 36 fields (6+12+18) have yields less than 1000 kg per acre. The next 24 fields have yields between 1000 and 1050 kg per acre. Therefore, the 50th and 51st fields will both have yields less than 1050 kg per acre, making the median less than 1050 kg per acre. **Option A is correct.**\n\n- **Percentage of Fields with Yield Less Than 1000 kg**: The first two categories, with yields less than 1000 kg, account for 6 + 12 = 18 fields. This is less than 80% of the total 100 fields. **Option B is incorrect.**\n\n- **Range of Yields**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is in the interval [900, 950), and the maximum yield is in the interval [1150, 1200). The range is thus more than 200 kg but less than 300 kg. **Option C is correct.**\n\n- **Average Yield**: To find the average, we would need to know the midpoint of each interval and multiply it by the frequency, then divide by the total number of fields. Without the exact midpoints, we cannot accurately calculate the average. However, since the distribution is skewed towards the higher end (with more fields having yields above 1000 kg), it is likely that the average is above 1000 kg. **Option D is likely incorrect.**\n\nGiven that options A and C are both correct based on our analysis, but we can only choose one option, we go with **Option A** because it is directly supported by the median calculation, which is more straightforward than the range calculation that requires assumptions about the distribution within the intervals.", "infer_time(s)": 39.77272, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['A']}\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms:**\n\nThe median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values when sorted.\n\nFrom the table, we can see that the first three classes contain $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$ fields, and the fourth class contains $24$ fields. This means the $50$th and $51$st fields fall into the $[1050, 1100)$ yield per acre category, indicating the median is less than $1100$ kilograms. Since the $50$th and $51$st values are in the same class, we don't need to calculate the exact median to know it's less than $1100$ kilograms and certainly less than $1050$ kilograms. Therefore, option A is correct.\n\n- **B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms:**\n\nTo check this, we add up the frequencies of the first two classes: $6 + 12 = 18$. This is less than $80\\%$ of $100$ fields ($80$ fields), so this statement is false.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms:**\n\nThe range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum is at most $1199$ kilograms (since it's in the $[1150, 1200)$ class but not exceeding $1200$). This gives a range of $1199 - 900 = 299$ kilograms, which is within $200$ to $300$ kilograms. However, since we don't have exact minimum and maximum values, we can't definitively say the range is within this range. Therefore, this option is not necessarily correct based on the information provided.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms:**\n\nTo find the average, we would need to know the midpoint of each class and multiply it by the frequency, then divide by the total number of fields. Without the midpoints of each class, we can't accurately calculate the average. Therefore, we can't confirm this statement as true based on the given information.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion that can be definitively drawn from the given information is **A.

Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when the data points are sorted.\n\n2. **Range**: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a data set.\n\n3. **Average (Mean)**: The mean is calculated by adding up all the values and dividing by the number of values.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms**: To find the median, we look at the cumulative frequencies. The 50th and 51st values fall in the interval $[1000, 1050)$, which means the median is less than 1050 kilograms. This statement is correct.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms**: To check this, we add up the frequencies for the intervals below 1000 kilograms. The cumulative frequency up to the interval $[950, 1000)$ is $6 + 12 = 18$, which is only 18% of the fields, not more than 80%. This statement is incorrect.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms**: The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. The lowest value is in the interval $[900, 950)$, and the highest value is in the interval $[1150, 1200)$. Thus, the range is between $1150 - 900 = 250$ kilograms and $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This statement is incorrect because the range is actually between 250 and 300 kilograms, not between 200 and 300 kilograms.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms**: Without the individual data points, we cannot accurately calculate the mean.

Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the information given in the table. The table shows the frequency distribution of the yield per acre for 100 fields. We can calculate the cumulative frequency to find the median class, the range, and the average yield per acre to evaluate each option.\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms**\n\n  To find the median, we first calculate the cumulative frequencies:\n\n  | Yield per acre   | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |\n  | ---------------- | --------- | -------------------- |\n  | $[900, 950)$     | $6$       | $6$                  |\n  | $[950, 1000)$    | $12$      | $18$                 |\n  | $[1000, 1050)$   | $18$      | $36$                 |\n  | $[1050, 1100)$   | $24$      | $60$                 |\n  | $[1100, 1150)$   | $18$      | $78$                 |\n  | $[1150, 1200)$   | $10$      | $88$                 |\n\n  The median is the value in the $\\frac{n+1}{2}$th position, where $n$ is the total number of observations. Since $n=100$, the median position is $50.5$. From the cumulative frequency, we can see that the median class is $[1050, 1100)$, which means the median yield per acre is less than 1100 kilograms. Thus, option A is correct.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms**\n\n  To check this statement, we look at the cumulative frequency for the class before $[1000, 1050)$. The cumulative frequency up to this class is 18, which is only 18% of the total fields, not more than 80%. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms**\n\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is in the class $[900, 950)$, and the maximum yield is in the class $[1150, 1200)$. The range is roughly $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms, which is within the given range. However, without the exact minimum and maximum values, we cannot conclusively say that the range is between 200 and 300 kilograms. Thus, option C is incorrect based on the information provided.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms**\n\n  To calculate the average, we would need the midpoint of each class and the total frequency. Without the exact midpoints and a proper calculation, we cannot accurately determine the average. However, given the distribution, it's clear that a significant portion of the yields are above 1000 kilograms, making it unlikely for the average to be less than 1000 kilograms.

The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms**\n\nThe median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since there are 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. \n\nFrom the table, we see that the first two classes ([900, 950) and [950, 1000)) contain 6 + 12 = 18 fields, and the third class ([1000, 1050)) contains 18 fields.

The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n   | Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n   | Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\n   Based on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct? ( )\n   - A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms\n   - B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms\n   - C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms\n   - D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms"}, "result": "## 4\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['A']}\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, we need to analyze the data provided in the table.\n\n- **Median Yield**: The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values when sorted.\n  \n  Looking at the frequencies, we can see that the first two categories ($[900, 950)$ and $[950, 1000)$) account for $6 + 12 = 18$ fields. The next category ($[1000, 1050)$) has $18$ fields, which brings the total to $18 + 18 = 36$ fields. The category after that ($[1050, 1100)$) has $24$ fields, which brings the total to $36 + 24 = 60$ fields. This means the $50$th and $51$st fields fall into this category. Since we're only looking at the lower bound of each category, the median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is indeed less than $1050$ kilograms. Option A is correct.\n\n- **Percentage of Fields with Yield Less Than $1000$ Kilograms**: The first three categories account for $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$ fields, which is $36\\%$ of the total fields. This is not more than $80\\%$, so option B is incorrect.\n\n- **Range of Yields**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The minimum is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum is at most $1199$ kilograms. This gives a range of at most $1199 - 900 = 299$ kilograms, which is not between $200$ and $300$ kilograms. Option C is incorrect.\n\n- **Average Yield**: Without the exact yields within each category, we cannot accurately calculate the average. However, even if we took the midpoint of each category and multiplied it by the frequency, then divided by the total number of fields, it's clear that the average would be skewed towards the middle categories, which are closer to $1000$ kilograms than to $900$ kilograms. Option D is not necessarily correct based on the information given.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct conclusion is A: \"The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms.\"", "infer_time(s)": 27.06542, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Multiple Choice\n\n### Original Problem\nAn agricultural research department planted new rice varieties in $100$ equal-sized fields and recorded the per acre yield (in kilograms) for each field. The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n\n| Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\nBased on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct? ( )\n\n- A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms\n- B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms\n- C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms\n- D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n### Solution Process\n\nTo determine the correct conclusion, let's analyze each statement using the information provided in the table:\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the $100$ fields is less than $1050$ kilograms:**\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. With $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values. From the table, we can see that the interval $[1000, 1050)$ contains $18$ fields, so the $50$th and $51$st values must fall within this range. Therefore, the median cannot be less than $1000$ kilograms, and this statement is **incorrect**.\n\n- **B. More than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms:**\n  To check this, we sum the frequencies of all fields with yields less than $1000$ kilograms: $6 + 12 = 18$ fields. This is out of $100$ fields, so the percentage is $\\frac{18}{100} = 18\\%$, which is not more than $80\\%$. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms:**\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum is in the interval $[900, 950)$, and the maximum is in the interval $[1150, 1200)$. Taking the smallest and largest possible values, the range would be $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This statement is **correct**.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms:**\n  Without the individual yields, we cannot calculate the exact average. However, we can estimate it by considering the midpoints of each interval and their frequencies. This calculation would be more involved and, without specific values, we cannot definitively say the average falls within this range. Therefore, this statement is **indeterminate** based on the given information.\n\n### Answer\n{'4': ['C']}", "infer_time(s)": 40.65236, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['C']}", "llm_answer": ["C"], "correct": true, "score": 5}}

The data is partially summarized in the following table:\n\n| Yield per acre | $[900, 950)$ | $[950, 1000)$ | $[1000, 1050)$ | $[1050, 1100)$ | $[1100, 1150)$ | $[1150, 1200)$ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Frequency | $6$ | $12$ | $18$ | $24$ | $18$ | $10$ |\n\nBased on the data in the table, which of the following conclusions is correct?

The range of the yields per acre for the $100$ fields is between $200$ kilograms and $300$ kilograms\n- D. The average yield per acre for the $100$ fields is between $900$ kilograms and $1000$ kilograms\n\n### Solution Process\nFirst, analyze each statement step by step:\n\n- A. To determine the median yield, we need to find the middle value(s) when the data is ordered. With $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values. From the table, we can see that the first $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$ fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms, and the next $24$ fields have yields between $[1000, 1050)$. Therefore, the $50$th and $51$st fields will be in this range, making the median less than $1050$ kilograms. This statement is correct.\n\n- B. To check if more than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields less than $1000$ kilograms, we look at the cumulative frequency up to the interval $[950, 1000)$. The cumulative frequency up to this point is $6 + 12 = 18$, which is only $18\\%$ of the total $100$ fields. This statement is incorrect.\n\n- C. The range of the yields is the difference between the maximum and minimum yields. From the table, the minimum yield is in the interval $[900, 950)$, and the maximum yield is in the interval $[1150, 1200)$. Thus, the range is between $1150 - 900 = 250$ kilograms and $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This statement is incorrect as the range is not between $200$ and $300$ kilograms.\n\n- D. To estimate the average yield, we would typically need the midpoints of each interval and the total yield. Without these specific values, we cannot accurately determine if the average yield is between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms. However, since the majority of the fields have yields in the higher intervals, it is likely that the average yield is higher than $900$ kilograms but we cannot definitively say it is below $1000$ kilograms. This statement is not necessarily correct based on the information provided.\n\n### Answer\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n\n{'4': ['A']}", "infer_time(s)": 41.68648, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1050 kilograms**:\n  The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have 100 fields, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we see that the interval $[1000, 1050)$ contains the 18th to 35th values, and the interval $[1050, 1100)$ contains the 36th to 60th values. Therefore, the 50th and 51st values both fall within the interval $[1000, 1050)$, making the median less than 1050 kilograms. This statement is correct.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms**:\n  To check this statement, we add the frequencies of the intervals below 1000 kilograms: $6 + 12 = 18$. This means that only 18 out of 100 fields have yields less than 1000 kilograms, which is 18%, not more than 80%. This statement is incorrect.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms**:\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum is in the interval $[900, 950)$, and the maximum is in the interval $[1150, 1200)$. The range is thus between $1150 - 900 = 250$ kilograms and $1200 - 900 = 300$ kilograms. This statement is incorrect.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms**:\n  To find the average, we would need the exact yields within each interval and the exact number of fields within those intervals. We can estimate, but without the exact data, we cannot confidently say the average is within this range.

The intervals are $[900, 950)$, $[950, 1000)$, $[1000, 1050)$, $[1050, 1100)$, $[1100, 1150)$, and $[1150, 1200)$.\n\n- **Step 2:** Evaluate Each Option\n\n  - **Option A:** To determine if the median yield per acre is less than $1050$ kilograms, we need to find the middle value. Since there are $100$ fields, the median will be the average of the $50$th and $51$st values when the data is sorted in ascending order. The cumulative frequency for the intervals up to and including $[1000, 1050)$ is $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$, which means the median must be in the interval $[1000, 1050)$. However, without more specific information, we cannot definitively say the median is less than $1050$ kilograms.\n  \n  - **Option B:** To check if more than $80\\%$ of the fields have yields per acre less than $1000$ kilograms, we look at the cumulative frequency up to the interval $[950, 1000)$. The cumulative frequency is $6 + 12 = 18$, which is only $18\\%$ of the total $100$ fields. This option is clearly incorrect.\n  \n  - **Option C:** The range of the yields per acre is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The minimum is at least $900$ kilograms, and the maximum is at most $1199$ kilograms (since it's in the interval $[1150, 1200)$ but less than $1200$). Thus, the range is $1199 - 900 = 299$ kilograms, which is not between $200$ and $300$ kilograms.\n  \n  - **Option D:** To estimate the average yield per acre, we can multiply the midpoint of each interval by the frequency, sum these products, and divide by the total number of fields. This gives a rough estimate of the average. Without calculating the exact average, we can observe that the majority of the fields (52 out of 100) have yields in the intervals $[1000, 1050)$ and $[1050, 1100)$, suggesting that the average yield is likely to be between $900$ and $1000$ kilograms.\n\n- **Step 3:** Conclusion\n\n  Given the analysis, option D is the most plausible conclusion based on the available data.

The table shows the frequency distribution of the yield per acre for the 100 fields.\n\n- **A. The median yield per acre for the 100 fields is less than 1100 kilograms**: The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have 100 data points (an even number), the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we can see that the 50th field's yield is in the interval $[1000, 1050)$, and the 51st field's yield is likely in the same interval or the next one, $[1050, 1100)$. Therefore, the median is less than 1100 kilograms.\n\n- **B. More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms**: To check this, we calculate the cumulative frequency up to the interval $[950, 1000)$. The cumulative frequency is $6 + 12 = 18$, which is 18% of the total 100 fields. This is not more than 80%, so this statement is incorrect.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms**: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is in the interval $[900, 950)$, and the maximum yield is in the interval $[1150, 1200)$. The range is at least $1150 - 900 = 250$ kilograms, which does not fit the statement.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms**: Without the exact values within each interval, we cannot accurately calculate the average. However, since the majority of the fields have yields in the intervals $[950, 1000)$ and $[1000, 1050)$, it is reasonable to assume that the average could be within this range, but we cannot definitively conclude this based on the information provided.\n\n### Answer\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct conclusion is:\n`{'4': ['A']}`", "infer_time(s)": 25.10155, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['A']}", "llm_answer": ["A"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The sum should be 100, but it adds up to 88. This discrepancy will affect our conclusions. However, we'll proceed with the given data.\n\n- To find the median yield, we need to locate the middle value(s) when the data is arranged in order. Since we have 88 fields (which is an even number), the median will be the average of the 44th and 45th values.\n\n- To find the percentage of fields with yields less than 1000 kilograms, we sum the frequencies of the first three classes and divide by the total number of fields.\n\n- The range of the yields is the difference between the maximum and minimum yield values.\n\n- To estimate the average yield per acre, we would typically multiply the midpoint of each class by the frequency, sum these values, and divide by the total number of fields. However, due to the discrepancy in the total number of fields, we'll have to adjust our understanding accordingly.\n\n### Answer\n\nGiven the mismatch in the total number of fields, we'll proceed with the assumption that the data is correct and the total is indeed 88 fields. The conclusions will be based on this assumption.\n\n- The median cannot be accurately determined without knowing the missing 12 fields' data.

The median is the middle value when the data is sorted. Since we have 100 data points, the median will be the average of the 50th and 51st values when sorted. From the table, we see that the first three classes ([900, 950), [950, 1000), [1000, 1050)) account for 6 + 12 + 18 = 36 fields, and the next class ([1050, 1100)) accounts for 24 fields. This means the 50th and 51st values fall within the [1050, 1100) class, making the median less than 1100 kilograms. Since the question asks if the median is less than 1050 kilograms, this statement is incorrect based on our analysis.\n\n- **Option B:** More than 80% of the fields have yields per acre less than 1000 kilograms. To test this, we add up the frequencies of all classes below 1000 kilograms: 6 (for [900, 950)) + 12 (for [950, 1000)) = 18 fields. This is out of 100 fields, so 18/100 = 18%, which is not more than 80%. This statement is false.\n\n- **Option C:** The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms. The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum yield is in the class [900, 950), and the maximum yield is in the class [1150, 1200). Even if we take the outer bounds of these classes (900 and 1200), the range would be 1200 - 900 = 300 kilograms. This statement is true, as the range is exactly 300 kilograms, which falls within the specified range of 200 to 300 kilograms.\n\n- **Option D:** The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms. To test this, we would ideally calculate the mean. However, without specific data points or midpoints of the classes and their frequencies, we can't accurately calculate the mean from the given table. This statement requires us to have more information to accurately verify.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the correct conclusion based on the information provided in the table is **Option C**.

The first three categories, $[900, 950)$, $[950, 1000)$, and $[1000, 1050)$, contain a total of $6 + 12 + 18 = 36$ fields. This is only 36% of the 100 fields, not more than 80%. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\n- **C. The range of the yields per acre for the 100 fields is between 200 kilograms and 300 kilograms:**\n\n  The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values. From the table, the minimum value is at least 900 kilograms, and the maximum value is at most 1199 kilograms. This gives a range of at least 299 kilograms and at most 300 kilograms, which does not fit the given range of 200 to 300 kilograms. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\n- **D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms:**\n\n  To estimate the average, we can calculate a rough midpoint for each category and multiply it by the frequency, then divide by the total number of fields.\n\n  - For $[900, 950)$, the midpoint is approximately $925$ kilograms, with a frequency of $6$.\n  - For $[950, 1000)$, the midpoint is approximately $975$ kilograms, with a frequency of $12$.\n  - For $[1000, 1050)$, the midpoint is approximately $1025$ kilograms, with a frequency of $18$.\n  - For $[1050, 1100)$, the midpoint is approximately $1075$ kilograms, with a frequency of $24$.\n  - For $[1100, 1150)$, the midpoint is approximately $1125$ kilograms, with a frequency of $18$.\n  - For $[1150, 1200)$, the midpoint is approximately $1175$ kilograms, with a frequency of $10$.\n\n  The sum of all these midpoints multiplied by their frequencies is $925 \\times 6 + 975 \\times 12 + 1025 \\times 18 + 1075 \\times 24 + 1125 \\times 18 + 1175 \\times 10$. This sum is divided by 100 to get the average.\n\n  Without calculating the exact sum, we can see that the majority of the values are clustered around the 1000 kilograms mark, with a significant portion also in the 1100s. This suggests that the average will be above 900 kilograms but likely below 1000 kilograms, given the distribution. Therefore, this option is correct.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct conclusion is D. The average yield per acre for the 100 fields is between 900 kilograms and 1000 kilograms.", "infer_time(s)": 47.59262, "token_usage": {}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'4': ['D']}", "llm_answer": ["D"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}
