Since A's cards are labeled with odd numbers and B's cards are labeled with even numbers, A will win a round if and only if A selects a card with a higher number than the card selected by B.\n\nThere are $4\\cdot4=16$ possible outcomes for each round. Let's list the favorable outcomes for A in each round:\n\nRound 1: A selects 3, 5, or 7; B selects any card.\nRound 2: A selects 5 or 7; B selects any card except the card with the highest number.\nRound 3: A selects 7; B selects any card except the two cards with the highest numbers.\nRound 4: A selects 7; B selects any card except the three cards with the highest numbers.\n\nThe probability that A wins a round is $\\frac{3}{4}$, $\\frac{2}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$, and $\\frac{1}{4}$, respectively, for each round.\n\nThe probability that A's total score is at least 2 after four rounds is the probability that A wins at least two rounds. This can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$P(\\text{A wins at least 2 rounds}) = P(\\text{A wins 2 rounds}) + P(\\text{A wins 3 rounds}) + P(\\text{A wins 4 rounds})$$\n\nUsing the multiplication rule, we have:\n\n$$P(\\text{A wins 2 rounds}) = \\binom{4}{2}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{18}{256}$$\n\n$$P(\\text{A wins 3 rounds}) = \\binom{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{6}{256}$$\n\n$$P(\\text{A wins 4 rounds}) = \\binom{4}{4}\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3}{256}$$\n\nTherefore, the probability that A's total score is at least 2 after four rounds is:\n\n$$P(\\text{A's total score is at least 2}) = \\frac{18}{256} + \\frac{6}{256} + \\frac{3}{256} = \\frac{27}{256}$$\n\n### Answer\n{'14': ['$\\frac{27}{256}$']}", "infer_time(s)": 35.16491, "token_usage": {"output_tokens": 607, "input_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 984}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$\\frac{27}{256}$']}", "llm_answer": ["$\\frac{27}{256}$"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The probability of A winning a round is $\\frac{3}{4}$, since A has 3 cards higher than each of B's cards.\n\nLet's count the number of ways A can win at least 2 rounds:\n\n* A wins 4 rounds: There is only 1 way to do this, which is A winning every round.\n* A wins 3 rounds: There are ${4 \\choose 3} = 4$ ways to do this, since A can choose any 3 rounds to win out of the 4 rounds.\n* A wins 2 rounds: There are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways to do this, since A can choose any 2 rounds to win out of the 4 rounds.\n\nThe total number of ways A can win at least 2 rounds is $1 + 4 + 6 = 11$. The total number of possible outcomes is $2^4 = 16$, since each round has 2 possible outcomes (A wins or B wins).\n\nTherefore, the probability that A's total score is at least 2 after four rounds is $\\frac{11}{16}$.", "infer_time(s)": 23.40229, "token_usage": {"output_tokens": 474, "input_tokens": 384, "total_tokens": 858}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$\\frac{11}{16}$']}", "llm_answer": ["$\\frac{11}{16}$"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The probability that A selects a higher number than B is $\\frac{4}{4}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{4}+\\frac{2}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{0}{4}=\\frac{6}{16}+\\frac{6}{16}+\\frac{2}{16}+0=\\frac{14}{16}$. \n\nNow, we need to find the probability that A wins at least 2 rounds. This is equivalent to finding the probability that A wins 2, 3, or 4 rounds. \n\nThe probability that A wins exactly 2 rounds is $\\binom{4}{2}\\left(\\frac{14}{16}\\right)^2\\left(1-\\frac{14}{16}\\right)^2=6\\cdot\\frac{196}{256}\\cdot\\frac{64}{256}=\\frac{2352}{16384}$. \n\nThe probability that A wins exactly 3 rounds is $\\binom{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{14}{16}\\right)^3\\left(1-\\frac{14}{16}\\right)^1=4\\cdot\\frac{2744}{4096}\\cdot\\frac{16}{256}=\\frac{1744}{16384}$. \n\nThe probability that A wins exactly 4 rounds is $\\binom{4}{4}\\left(\\frac{14}{16}\\right)^4\\left(1-\\frac{14}{16}\\right)^0=1\\cdot\\frac{3844}{65536}\\cdot1=\\frac{3844}{65536}$. \n\nAdding these probabilities together, we get $\\frac{2352}{16384}+\\frac{1744}{16384}+\\frac{3844}{65536}=\\frac{11}{16}$. \n\nTherefore, the probability that A’s total score is at least 2 after four rounds is $\\boxed{\\frac{11}{16}}$.", "infer_time(s)": 32.31523, "token_usage": {"output_tokens": 636, "input_tokens": 406, "total_tokens": 1042}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$\\frac{11}{16}$']}", "llm_answer": ["$\\frac{11}{16}$"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The probability that A’s total score is at least 2 after four rounds is ________.\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\nTo find the probability that A’s total score is at least 2 after four rounds, we can first find the probability that A’s total score is exactly 2, then add the probabilities that A’s total score is 3 or 4.\n\nLet's find the probability that A’s total score is exactly 2. This can happen in the following ways:\n- A wins 2 rounds and loses 2 rounds. This can happen in 6 ways, since there are 4 rounds to choose from and we need to choose 2 of them for A to win.\n- The probability that A wins a round is $\\frac{3}{4}$, since A has 3 cards with numbers higher than B's cards.\n- The probability that A loses a round is $\\frac{1}{4}$, since A has 1 card with a number lower than B's cards.\n- So, the probability that A’s total score is exactly 2 is $\\frac{6 \\times 3^2 \\times 1^2}{4^4} = \\frac{27}{256}$.\n\nNow, let's find the probability that A’s total score is exactly 3. This can happen in the following way:\n- A wins 3 rounds and loses 1 round. This can happen in 4 ways, since there are 4 rounds to choose from and we need to choose 1 of them for A to lose.\n- So, the probability that A’s total score is exactly 3 is $\\frac{4 \\times 3^3 \\times 1^1}{4^4} = \\frac{108}{256}$.\n\nFinally, let's find the probability that A’s total score is exactly 4. This can happen in the following way:\n- A wins all 4 rounds. This can happen in 1 way, since A needs to win all rounds.\n- So, the probability that A’s total score is exactly 4 is $\\frac{1 \\times 3^4 \\times 1^0}{4^4} = \\frac{81}{256}$.\n\nNow, we can add up the probabilities to find the probability that A’s total score is at least 2: $\\frac{27}{256} + \\frac{108}{256} + \\frac{81}{256} = \\frac{216}{256} = \\frac{27}{32}$.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'14': ['$\\frac{27}{32}$']}", "infer_time(s)": 32.53249, "token_usage": {"output_tokens": 661, "input_tokens": 406, "total_tokens": 1067}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$\\frac{27}{32}$']}", "llm_answer": ["$\\frac{27}{32}$"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

The probability that A’s total score is at least 2 after four rounds is ________.\n\n***\n\n### Answer\n{'14': ['$\\frac{11}{16}$']}\n\n***\n\n### Solution Process\nLet's first find the total number of outcomes. In each round, there are 4 choices for A and 4 choices for B, so there are $4 \\times 4 = 16$ outcomes in each round. Since there are 4 rounds, there are $16^4$ total outcomes.\n\nNow, let's count the number of outcomes where A's total score is at least 2. We can separate this into three cases: A wins 2 rounds, A wins 3 rounds, and A wins 4 rounds.\n\nIf A wins 2 rounds, then B wins 2 rounds. There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ ways to choose which rounds A wins, and then there are $3 \\times 3$ ways to choose the cards in the rounds that A wins, and $3 \\times 3$ ways to choose the cards in the rounds that B wins. Therefore, there are $6 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 486$ outcomes where A wins 2 rounds.\n\nIf A wins 3 rounds, then B wins 1 round. There are $\\binom{4}{3} = 4$ ways to choose which rounds A wins, and then there are $3 \\times 3 \\times 3$ ways to choose the cards in the rounds that A wins, and $3$ ways to choose the cards in the rounds that B wins. Therefore, there are $4 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 324$ outcomes where A wins 3 rounds.\n\nIf A wins 4 rounds, then there are $3 \\times 3 \\times 3 \\times 3 = 81$ outcomes where A wins 4 rounds.\n\nTherefore, the total number of outcomes where A's total score is at least 2 is $486 + 324 + 81 = 891$.

Since A's cards are labeled with odd numbers and B's cards are labeled with even numbers, A will always win if they draw an odd-numbered card and B draws an even-numbered card. \n\nThere are 4 rounds, and A needs to win at least 2 rounds to have a total score of at least 2. \n\nLet's count the number of ways A can win exactly 2 rounds, exactly 3 rounds, and all 4 rounds:\n\n- A wins exactly 2 rounds: There are ${4 \\choose 2} = 6$ ways to choose the 2 rounds A wins. In each of these rounds, A has a 1/2 chance of winning, and in the other two rounds, A has a 1/2 chance of losing. So, the probability of A winning exactly 2 rounds is $6 \\times (1/2)^4 = 6/16$.\n\n- A wins exactly 3 rounds: There are ${4 \\choose 3} = 4$ ways to choose the 3 rounds A wins. In each of these rounds, A has a 1/2 chance of winning, and in the other round, A has a 1/2 chance of losing. So, the probability of A winning exactly 3 rounds is $4 \\times (1/2)^4 = 4/16$.\n\n- A wins all 4 rounds: There is only 1 way to choose all 4 rounds A wins. In each of these rounds, A has a 1/2 chance of winning. So, the probability of A winning all 4 rounds is $1 \\times (1/2)^4 = 1/16$.\n\nThe probability that A's total score is at least 2 after four rounds is the sum of these probabilities: $(6/16) + (4/16) + (1/16) = 11/16$.", "infer_time(s)": 23.15402, "token_usage": {"output_tokens": 433, "input_tokens": 355, "total_tokens": 788}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$\\frac{11}{16}$']}", "llm_answer": ["$\\frac{11}{16}$"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}

Since the cards are discarded after each round, the total number of possible outcomes for each round is 4 × 4 = 16. \n\nWe can list all the possible outcomes for A's cards: 1, 3, 5, 7. For each outcome, we can list the corresponding outcomes for B's cards: 2, 4, 6, 8. \n\nFor A to get at least 2 points, A must win at least 2 rounds. Let's count the number of ways A can win at least 2 rounds:\n\n- A wins 4 rounds: There is only 1 way for this to happen (A selects 7, 5, 5, 3, and B selects 2, 4, 6, 8, respectively, or some permutation of these selections).\n- A wins 3 rounds: There are 4 ways for this to happen (A selects 7, 5, 5, 1, and B selects 2, 4, 6, 8, respectively, or some permutation of these selections).\n- A wins 2 rounds: There are 6 ways for this to happen (A selects 7, 5, 3, 3, and B selects 2, 4, 6, 8, respectively, or some permutation of these selections).\n\nTherefore, there are 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 ways for A to get at least 2 points.

In the first round, the probability of 甲 winning is $\\frac{3}{4}$ (since 甲 has 3 cards greater than 乙's smallest card), and the probability of 甲 losing is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n2. In the second round, if 甲 won in the first round, the probability of 甲 winning again is $\\frac{2}{3}$ (since 甲 has 2 cards greater than 乙's second-smallest card), and the probability of 甲 losing is $\\frac{1}{3}$. If 甲 lost in the first round, the probability of 甲 winning is $\\frac{3}{3}$ (since 甲 has all cards greater than 乙's smallest card), and the probability of 甲 losing is $0$.\n3. We can continue this analysis for the third and fourth rounds.\n4. After calculating the probabilities of 甲 winning or losing in each round, we can find the probability of 甲's total score being at least 2. This can be done by adding up the probabilities of the following scenarios:\n\t* 甲 wins 2 rounds and loses 2 rounds\n\t* 甲 wins 3 rounds and loses 1 round\n\t* 甲 wins 4 rounds and loses 0 rounds\n5.

For each round, A has 4 choices and B has 4 choices. Since the cards are discarded after each round, the choices are independent. Therefore, there are a total of $4^4 \\times 4^4 = 256$ possible outcomes.\n\nLet's count the number of outcomes where A's total score is at least 2. This can happen in three ways:\n\n1. A wins 4 rounds: There is only 1 outcome where A wins all 4 rounds.\n2. A wins 3 rounds: For each of the 4 rounds, there are 3 ways for A to win and 1 way for B to win. Therefore, there are $4 \\times 3 \\times 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 12$ outcomes where A wins 3 rounds.\n3.

Since the cards are discarded after each round, we can consider each round independently.\n\nIn each round, A wins if they draw a card with a higher number than B. The probability of A winning a round is:\n\n* A draws 1, B draws 2: A loses (probability 1/4 × 1/4 = 1/16)\n* A draws 3, B draws 2 or 4: A wins (probability 1/4 × 2/4 = 1/8)\n* A draws 5, B draws 2, 4, or 6: A wins (probability 1/4 × 3/4 = 3/8)\n* A draws 7, B draws 2, 4, 6, or 8: A wins (probability 1/4 × 4/4 = 1)\n\nSo, the probability of A winning a round is 1/8 + 3/8 + 1 = 11/16.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that A's total score is at least 2 after four rounds. This means A wins at least two rounds. Let's count the number of ways this can happen:\n\n* A wins 4 rounds: probability (11/16)⁴\n* A wins 3 rounds and loses 1 round: probability 4 × (11/16)³ × (5/16)\n* A wins 2 rounds and loses 2 rounds: probability 6 × (11/16)² × (5/16)²\n\nAdd up these probabilities:\n\n(11/16)⁴ + 4 × (11/16)³ × (5/16) + 6 × (11/16)² × (5/16)² = 11/16\n\nSo, the probability that A's total score is at least 2 after four rounds is **11/16**.", "infer_time(s)": 25.74574, "token_usage": {"output_tokens": 466, "input_tokens": 377, "total_tokens": 843}, "answer": {"raw_answer": "{'14': ['$\\frac{11}{16}$']}", "llm_answer": ["$\\frac{11}{16}$"], "correct": false, "score": 0}}
